Currency of Empire: The Hidden War that Destroys Nations Without a Shot
By Elya Marin & Khoni Chin

Beneath the visible clashes of armies and the noise of politics, another kind of war has been quietly reshaping the world. It is a war fought not with bullets, but with ledgers, liquidity, and trust. Currency of Empire unveils a narrative where fiction and reality intertwine—where a novel’s plot about secretive monetary sabotage begins to mirror the events outside its pages.

From Istanbul to Seoul, from shadowy boardrooms to encrypted backchannels, this book reveals how empires rise and fall on the battlefield of currency. Every chapter draws upon real data points and geopolitical fractures, reimagined through a fictional frame that feels unnervingly close to tomorrow’s headlines.

Part thriller, part documentary, part warning—Currency of Empire forces readers to confront a truth long hidden: the most decisive wars of our century may already be over, won or lost without a single shot fired.



Reader Advisory (Preface Warning)

The authors offer a caution at the outset: this book will not provide direct answers to many of the questions it raises. Readers may expect clarifications, timelines, or definitive interpretations; such expectations will not be met here.

Instead, Currency of Empire* is deliberately constructed as a fractured mirror. The missing answers may—or may not—be found in the authors’ earlier non-fiction works. Readers who choose to cross-reference, compare, and reconstruct meaning across multiple texts are free to do so, but any conclusion assembled from such efforts will receive neither affirmation nor denial from the authors.

This is not evasion, but design. It is the refusal to close a circle that must remain open. The reader is invited into the labyrinth; whether they find coherence or contradiction is entirely their burden.









# **Chapter 1: The Resignation Letter**

Erkez sat alone in the gray-lit office of the contractor building, the hum of fluorescent lights pressing down on his shoulders. Outside, the city was just waking, but inside, the air was thick with numbers, spreadsheets, and the weight of decisions he no longer wanted to make.

He opened a blank document on his terminal. Its title read: **Resignation Letter**. His fingers hovered, uncertain. This wasn’t just a letter to HR—it was a severing of ties, a declaration to himself.

For months, he had been part of a project so secretive that even his closest colleagues spoke in codenames. “Monetary Weaponization”—a sanitized phrase for what he now knew was far more dangerous. The models he had built, the simulations he had run, were meant to destabilize currencies under the guise of economic research.

He glanced at a file folder labeled *Confidential – Treasury/CIA Joint Working Group, 2018*. Inside, slides showed USDT reserves allegedly backed by dollars—but the data was inconsistent, fragmented. Tether had refused comprehensive audits. Erkez remembered thinking, *“An entire shadow banking system, hidden in plain sight.”*

Another tab on his screen displayed a PDF: the 2020 lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General against Tether. The headline was simple, almost mundane: *“Company misrepresents reserves.”* But the implications were enormous. Insufficient reserves. Potential collapse. An “off-balance-sheet” risk of unprecedented scale.

He knew the numbers. He had worked with them. And he had a choice.

Erkez began typing:

> *I hereby resign from my position with immediate effect. I cannot, in good conscience, continue to support the ongoing operations of the Monetary Weaponization Project…*

The words felt heavier than he anticipated. Each sentence was a fracture—a crack in the façade that had been his professional life.

He read it one last time, then pressed **Print**. The printer whirred, the paper sliding out slowly, like a ledger balancing itself against an invisible weight. When he picked it up, the smell of toner sharp in his nostrils, he realized something: he wasn’t just resigning from a job. He was stepping away from a war that no one outside the walls of this office could even comprehend.

Erkez folded the letter neatly, slipped it into an envelope, and tucked it into his briefcase. Outside, the morning sun glinted off skyscrapers that had no idea the battles being fought inside their shadows.












**Farewell Lunch and Conversation at Home**

The lunch took place at an unassuming restaurant in Washington. Sunlight streamed through the windows, scattering across the tablecloth and reflecting off the silverware with a cold gleam. Sitting across from Erkez were his former boss, with whom he had worked for many years, and several colleagues.

“Are you serious?” one of the bosses sipped his coffee, the tone laced with barely concealed teasing. “Resigning to write a novel? You know how solid our models are—no matter what you do, the results won’t change.”

Another colleague shook his head with a smile. “Or is it that you’re just tired? Emotional issues? Too much stress?”

Erkez merely smiled faintly, fingers tapping lightly on the table, as if everything around him were just scenery—and the scenery beyond the scenery was entirely his own plan. He was calm, composed, as though this lunch were nothing more than a routine social ritual, rather than the culmination of a major decision he had made.

When lunch ended, the streets bathed in sunlight seemed far brighter than the gray office light. Erkez walked back to his apartment alone, his steps steady, his gaze carrying thoughts left unspoken.

---

Back at home, Roya was in the kitchen preparing coffee. Hearing movement at the door, she looked up.

“Why did you suddenly resign? This… is so sudden.” Her voice carried both anticipation and a trace of disappointment.

Erkez set down his briefcase and smiled faintly. “I… want to write a book.”

Roya blinked, as if trying to catch the meaning hidden behind his words. She understood he hadn’t said everything and had deliberately avoided the core question. A subtle sense of loss stirred in her heart: she had always imagined that Erkez would continue to build influence within the U.S. system, paving the way for Iran’s secularists and potential future reforms.

“A book…” she repeated softly, her eyes reflecting a complex mixture of hope and doubt. “So… will you keep doing this?”

Erkez remained silent for a moment. His smile didn’t fade, but it seemed separated by a transparent barrier—warm, yet untouchable. He knew that some secrets must be borne alone.










## **Chapter Two: Shattered Illusions**

Roya sat on the living room sofa, a cup of steaming coffee in her hands. Sunlight streamed in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting its glow on her face—still a little youthful, yet marked with determination.

Her story unfolded like a hidden river flowing quietly—growing up in the Iranian community of Los Angeles, where her parents still strictly observed religious customs. Daily life was filled with prayers, festivals, and traditional rules. Yet she herself had become completely secular, participating in rituals only out of courtesy, never from the heart.

“You’re writing a book?” She lifted her head, her eyes gleaming. “That’s even better. Maybe the book you write could become a beacon for Iran’s future.”

At her words, Erkez’s lips moved faintly, but he did not reply.

Inside him, a tide of complicated emotions stirred—he knew all too well that America’s system had never allowed any other country to replicate it wholesale. Even modest suggestions or small-scale reforms, if carried out to their extreme, would be seen as rebellion.

He looked at Roya, his heart caught between reason and feeling. He could shatter her illusions, force her to confront the harshness of reality—but instead, he chose silence.

That silence was not indifference, but protection. He knew that once she truly grasped the cruelty of the real world, her dreams would be broken beyond repair. For now, letting her hold on to hope was better than making her face the truth too soon.

“I just… want to write some things down,” he finally said softly. His tone carried a hint of tenderness, yet remained as steady as stone.

Roya nodded gently. She did not fully understand, but in that moment, she chose to believe him—to believe that hidden within his words was the light she longed for.

Outside, the breeze stirred the curtains, and within the room flowed a quiet tension left unspoken. The fracture between fantasy and reality showed itself faintly in that instant, though it had not yet widened.













## **The Fracture Between Ideal and Reality**

Roya sat quietly by the window, her fingers tapping the rim of her coffee cup, eyes drifting toward the distant skyline.

“One day,” she whispered, her voice carrying a faint tremor, “Iran will be secularized—just like America. Rule of law, checks and balances… the path to modernity. People will no longer be bound by religion or tradition, but will live in the balance of freedom and order.”

Erkez listened in silence. Her words floated through the room like a soft breeze, yet cut into him like a sharpened blade. He knew too well how fragile such a dream was—so fragile it was nearly transparent against reality.

In his mind, the truth unfolded: a powerful America would never allow another nation to replicate its system. To do so would be to create a second America, and for Washington’s architecture of power, that was nothing less than an act of rebellion.

He spoke softly, careful not to shatter her vision outright:
“Roya, did you know? During Iran’s Green Revolution in 2009, Twitter and Facebook briefly became the battlefield of public opinion. The U.S. State Department even quietly asked Twitter to delay its scheduled maintenance—just to keep the voices of the protesters alive online.”

Roya blinked, not fully grasping the implication.

Erkez went on:
“And in Iraq. In Afghanistan. Attempts to transplant a system. What looked from the outside like democracy and order… proved unworkable on the ground.”

He paused, met her gaze, and spoke with gentle but unyielding certainty:
“Institutions aren’t something you can copy and paste. Even if you dream of Iran’s modernization, reality will tell you this: every attempt to become a ‘second America’ will collide with powers far stronger than yourself.”

Roya fell silent. Doubt flickered in her eyes, though the ember of hope had not fully dimmed. She did not yet understand the full weight of the forces he spoke of—but she sensed that the road ahead was far more tangled, far more perilous, than she had imagined.

Outside, the wind stirred, lifting the edges of the pages on the table. And in that small gesture of air, the fracture between ideal and reality quietly revealed itself.











## **Chapter Three: The Desk and the Dinner**

A winter night in Washington. Outside the apartment, the wind stirred the flag on the street corner. Inside, the lights were warm.

Erkez closed his notebook as the scent of dinner spread through the air. Roya set the plates on the table and sat across from him as though preparing to conduct an interrogation.

“That scene you wrote,” she pointed her fork at his computer, “why would Turkish banks accept so much USDT without collateral? Are you hinting at the U.S. Treasury?”

Erkez smiled faintly and reached for the wine bottle to pour her a glass. “I’m writing a novel.”

“Don’t play dumb.” Roya fixed her gaze on him like a journalist eyeing her subject. “Your logic is too real to be fiction.”

Erkez didn’t answer directly. Instead, he calmly sliced into his steak. He knew—any extra word, even an innocent explanation, could cross a line.

“Fiction,” he repeated, with the steady composure trained into CIA officers.

After a pause, Roya suddenly laughed. “Every time you dodge like that, it only makes me more certain what you wrote is true.”

He shrugged, offering no further argument.

After dinner, he sat back at his desk alone. His fingertips struck the keyboard, and line by line the words appeared on the screen:

> **“Phase One: Stablecoins enter Turkey’s cross-border payment market. On the surface, they resolve issues of sanctions and foreign exchange—but in reality, they quietly bind the entire economic system to U.S. dollar liquidity.”**

Every step followed perfect logic, every link looked harmless. But in his mind he knew—it was a silent trap.










The warmth of the dinner table had not yet faded. Roya crossed her arms, half-squinting at him.
“So you really plan to turn all that into a novel?”

Erkez nodded. “Yes. A *pseudo-novel*.”

“Pseudo?” Roya raised an eyebrow.

“It’s not disclosure.” He paused, as if weighing his words. “What I write can only *allude to risks*. That’s completely different from leaking secrets.”

“But you make it sound too real.” Roya slid her glass forward, lowering her voice. “Reading it feels more like… a warning.”

Erkez gave a faint smile, though his eyes stayed calm. “You know *The Big Short*, right? That book was based entirely on real data—back in 2008, U.S. regulators already knew derivatives were dangerous, yet they still let the bubble swell. When the crash came, no one in the market could stop it.”

He paused, then added, “Or take 2021: the Turkish lira lost **44%** of its value in a single year—a record collapse. Every report in the market showed it happening, but no one could alter the trend.”

Roya listened, entranced, her fingers tapping unconsciously against the table.

“So…” she lifted her gaze, “even if everything in your novel is true, it’s only a projection of risk. It won’t change reality.”

“Exactly.” Erkez spoke softly. “A novel can forewarn, but it cannot reverse.”

The room fell into a brief silence. Roya’s eyes lingered on his face, as if weighing the precision of his words.

“But you’re still gambling,” she said slowly, “gambling that this book will at least wake *some* people up.”

Erkez didn’t answer. He simply reached out and closed the notebook.












After dinner, the air at the desk still carried the aftertaste of arguments from the dining table.
Roya opened her laptop, pulled up the interview plan, and her fingers tapped quickly across the keyboard.
Across from her, at the old wooden desk, Erkez kept working on his “pseudo-novel,” his laptop filling with line after line of cryptic reasoning.

From time to time, Roya would stroll over like a patrolling cat, glancing at the manuscript.
When she saw him pause, pen halted in mid-thought, she simply stood behind him, silent, waiting for him to look up.
Erkez would always sigh softly, as if conceding, smoothing the paper flat, bracing for her question.

---

**Roya** (raising a brow, voice both gentle and pressing): Why insist on launching a currency war with cryptocurrency? Isn’t it enough if people willingly use stablecoins?

**Erkez** (speaking slowly, as though drafting lines of dialogue): America has stopped fighting foreign wars, yet the Treasury must keep issuing bonds.
Stablecoins are tied only to short-term U.S. debt, but what the U.S. needs are mid- and long-term bonds to stabilize its finances.
Currency internationalization has always been a blend of “voluntary” and “forced.”
Wars may end, but dollar hegemony cannot be weakened—only reinforced.

**Roya** (taking a step closer, voice low): But if people choose stablecoins voluntarily, isn’t that fine?

**Erkez**: The problem is that “voluntary” depends on the black market.
Since stablecoins emerged, sham foreign-trade invoices have surged across Africa, South America, and the Middle East.
The black market acts as a lubricant, but now it has reached its limit.

**Roya**: What about cryptocurrency then? The president called it air in the last term, and in this one issued a stablecoin himself.

**Erkez** (pausing, eyes sharp): Cryptocurrency is defined by truth.
Every transaction on-chain, every record public.
Once your wallet is bound to your real-world identity, every single deal—none can slip away.
In the past, even if a state caught a criminal, the ledgers weren’t always complete; the loot wasn’t always recovered.
Now, the ledger is 100% transparent.

**Roya** (quick, challenging): But isn’t decentralization and anonymity its biggest feature? How could what you’re saying be true?

**Erkez**: Only if your crypto was mined, never once exchanged for real-world money.
Stablecoins are different—they banned mining from the start. They can only be purchased.

**Roya** (relentless): Then people can just keep using Bitcoin.

**Erkez**: Decentralization means everyone keeps the books.
Every single participant records every single transaction.
The volume of data grows exponentially with every login update.
In under five years, decentralized crypto will collapse under its own weight.

**Roya** (pausing, shifting angle): Then what, exactly, are stablecoins?

**Erkez** (looking up, faintly): Alipay.

**Roya** (caught off guard, scoffing): What?

**Erkez**: Alipay.

**Roya** (fixing her gaze on him, as if to strip away every layer): So you’re not going to explain further?

**Erkez** (hiding a smile, closing the laptop): No. I can only give you an index.











### Chapter Four: Shadow Currency

On a weekend afternoon, sunlight slanted into the study. Roya closed her laptop, slid over to Erkez’s side, and picked up the thick manuscript.

She flipped to a new chapter. At the top, it read:

> *“In Turkey, the shadow central bank is not some secretive, gray institution—it is a public consensus.
> When inflation devours the lira like wildfire, people discover that what truly preserves purchasing power is not paper notes, but the cold, unfeeling stablecoin on the blockchain—USDT.
> The lira still circulates, but only as a supporting role; the real anchor of prices is set by those virtual digital chips.”*

Roya frowned and looked up. “Isn’t this just conspiracy theory? People will laugh at you.”

Erkez didn’t argue. He only replied, almost casually: “Maybe.”

For a few seconds, the room was silent. Then Roya tapped her finger lightly on the desk, cutting to the point: “Do you really think the Turkish people will abandon the lira?”

“They already have.” Erkez didn’t hesitate.

He slid a sheet of paper across to her. On it were a few lines of numbers:

* **2022 Chainalysis Report**: Turkey ranked consistently among the world’s top five cryptocurrency markets.
* **USDT Usage**: Long-standing number one globally.
* **On the ground**: Under crushing inflation, Turkish families convert their wages into USDT, circulating it on the black market, in e-commerce, even in small corner shops.

“This isn’t my invention.” Erkez pointed to the data. “This is reality.”

Roya’s eyes lingered on one phrase—\*“people’s central bank.”\*¹ Suddenly she felt the boundary between fiction and reality blur, bit by bit.

---

¹ *Here “people’s central bank” does not mean a formal institution. It refers to a **de facto monetary system** created by the public consensus of using USDT as the unit of account and store of value.*








Roya rubbed her temples and asked softly, “Then won’t the government intervene? The central bank can’t possibly sit back while the public builds its own central bank.”

Erkez gave a faint smile. “Intervene? They’ve tried. But the circulation of USDT doesn’t run through traditional channels. The money trail and transaction records are scattered across global nodes, leaving almost zero room for official control. Even if the central bank freezes bank accounts, peer-to-peer trade continues without pause.”

He flipped open his laptop and pointed at a few headlines:

* **2021: Turkish lira loses 44% of its value in a single year**
* **USDT trading volume skyrockets**
* **Black market exchanges hit daily limits, still fall short of demand**

“See,” Erkez went on, “people voluntarily convert lira into USDT to hedge against inflation. In essence, that creates a *people’s central bank*. Stablecoins aren’t charity; they operate strictly by market logic—if people willingly exchange into them, they exist.”

Roya looked up, her eyes gleaming with thought. “But can such a shadow central bank really remain stable over the long term? What if USDT collapses?”

Erkez answered calmly, “Long term? No one can promise that. USDT is essentially a centralized ledger—backed by corporate reserves, subject to adjustments, issuance, even cancellations at will. That’s why it can function like a bank, yet with more flexibility. As for decentralized, anonymous currencies? Unrealistic. The data load grows exponentially. Within five years, the system would choke itself.”

Roya chuckled softly. “So that’s why you say USDT is just Alipay.”

Erkez nodded. “Exactly. Except that in Turkey, its ‘Alipay’ function has quietly taken the front line of a currency war—rewriting national economic order before anyone notices.”

Roya murmured under her breath, “Shadow central bank… shadow war…”²

Erkez paused for a few seconds. “Remember, this is only a novel. But every story has a shadow in reality. You can read it as fiction—or as a warning.”

In the study, sunlight fell across the manuscript. The words shimmered like a thin mist, both imagined and real, refracting the fragility and risks of the world outside.

---

**² *Shadow central bank / shadow war*:** In this context, the “shadow central bank” refers to the grassroots, market-driven adoption of stablecoins like USDT, which operate outside official monetary systems yet effectively influence national economies. The “shadow war” describes the silent, non-military struggle over currency sovereignty, where financial flows and digital ledgers replace armies and battlefields.

**³ *Alipay reference*:** Alipay, China’s dominant digital payment platform, became a case study for U.S. policymakers and financial strategists. Its success in integrating payments, credit, and daily consumption created a blueprint for large-scale monetary control. For years, U.S. institutions quietly examined how Alipay’s model could be adapted—not for domestic use, where the dollar’s supremacy remains untouchable—but as a tool to govern economic activity beyond U.S. borders. In this sense, “Alipay” becomes a metaphor for a controlled payment ecosystem designed to extend influence abroad while keeping the American homeland a restricted zone.








Roya closed the laptop softly, frowning.
“In your novel’s Turkey,” she asked, “would people really accept USDT instead of the lira? Wouldn’t they resist?”

Erkez set down his pen, his gaze drifting past the window toward the Washington streets.
“Resist? Do you think resistance changes anything? Inflation and devaluation are oppression in themselves. Ordinary people only want to preserve value. The only option left is to exchange their wages for something that still holds purchasing power. In Turkey, the circulation of USDT has long slipped beyond official control.”

He pointed to several figures on a sheet of paper:

* **Chainalysis 2022 Report:** Turkey ranked among the world’s top five crypto markets; USDT usage consistently #1.
* **Grassroots reality:** Turkish households hedge inflation through USDT, forming a *de facto* shadow central bank.
* **Black market:** Daily conversion caps and fluctuating official rates, yet still demand outstrips supply.

Roya asked softly, “Then doesn’t this shadow central bank risk becoming America’s tool?”

Erkez nodded. “Exactly. Stablecoins are weapons in a currency war—legal, discreet, able to infiltrate industry, logistics, and finance. Managed correctly, they leave the target nation’s currency almost defenseless. USDT isn’t just a coin. It’s America’s *invisible army* on the battlefield of money.”

Roya tilted her head, half-smile, half-concern. “So your novel isn’t just a warning—it’s hinting at the trajectory of the real world.”

A faint smile crossed Erkez’s face. “Between warning and narrative, there’s only a sheet of paper. If the reader understands, it’s revelation. If not—it remains just a story. Reality’s cracks often begin with fiction.”

The two returned to their desks: Roya sorting her interview plans, Erkez lowering his head over the keyboard. The room was quiet, broken only by the soft strokes of pen on paper and the muted tapping of keys. Each click moved a piece across an invisible chessboard—fictional, yet mirroring reality.

Now and then, Roya paused, stealing a glance at him. Her eyes carried curiosity—and a touch of testing.
“Are you worried I’ll understand too much?”

Erkez set his hands down and replied evenly, “What worries me isn’t you understanding too much—it’s me saying too much. The thickness of a novel is the safety line that protects both writer and reader.”

Outside, the sunlight spilled across the manuscript, paper glinting faintly. Shadows and light interwove, like the fragile seam between fiction and reality—at once delicate, and dangerous.










Roya set down her pen and looked up, frowning.
“The black market has daily limits, right? If Turks want to exchange lira for USDT, isn’t that illegal? Does Turkey even allow people to buy USDT directly with lira?”

Erkez leaned back in his chair, his tone calm.
“Strictly speaking, USDT isn’t currency. It’s a digital product issued by the company Tether. Think of it as virtual coins inside a video game.”

He continued, “When you buy one USDT, the company purchases one dollar’s worth of U.S. Treasury bonds. But that doesn’t mean USDT equals the U.S. dollar. It isn’t legal tender, nor is it regulated by banks. That’s its gray zone: it can be *used* as money, but it doesn’t formally belong to the monetary system.”

Roya narrowed her eyes slightly.
“Then why would Turks dare to use it? Isn’t that too risky?”

Erkez pointed at the chart glowing on his screen.
“The risk exists at the official level, yes. But public demand far outweighs it. With soaring inflation and a collapsing lira, people only want to preserve value. In that situation, USDT becomes a kind of shadow bridge—temporarily moving private wealth outside the grasp of official control.”

He added a datapoint:
“In 2022, Turkey’s inflation hit 64%, and the lira lost over 40% of its value against the dollar. In that environment, citizens had virtually no choice. USDT simply provided a workable alternative.”

Roya studied him thoughtfully.
“So your novel isn’t just a story—it’s sketching a potential reality. Stablecoins as invisible weapons, already stronger than national currencies.”

Erkez smiled faintly, neither confirming nor denying.
“Exactly. A novel is a war on paper—but every page can mirror a crack in reality. The deeper you understand, the more dangerous the story’s thickness becomes.”

They fell silent for a moment, until the sound of typing returned. Roya leaned sideways, sneaking a glance at the words Erkez was striking out on the keyboard. Questions piled up in her mind, but she knew: every attempt to probe had to be careful, never pushing him to reveal the core secrets.

Outside, sunlight streamed dappled into the study—spilling across the pages like shifting shadows, blurring the fragile line between the virtual and the real.












Roya edged carefully closer to the desk, blinking.
“If USDT were allowed to be purchased directly with lira, what would happen?”

Erkez pointed at the exchange-rate comparison on his screen.
“Turks always check both the official rate and the black-market rate—and usually they follow the black market. The moment USDT accepts lira directly, it can set its *own* exchange rate at will. People would only recognize the USDT rate.”

He paused, his tone steady.
“Once USDT lowers that rate, the lira effectively devalues. All of Turkey’s interventions in the international currency market would become meaningless. The public wouldn’t care about official measures—they’d only follow the shadow central bank.”

Roya exhaled sharply.
“So USDT completely seizes public trust, leaving the authorities powerless to intervene.”

Erkez nodded.
“That is the power of a shadow currency. On the surface it looks like a legitimate transaction, but in essence, it’s a weapon of monetary warfare.”











Roya stared at the transaction-volume chart on the screen, her brows furrowed.
“Then what can ordinary people even do with lira? How long can the black market hold out?”

Erkez pointed to the other side of the chart.
“Look here—daily black-market exchange caps are limited. People can only cash out small amounts of lira from time to time. USDT can adjust its conversion rate at will, and the public has no way to counterbalance it.”

He paused, his voice dropping lower.
“The official lira exchange rate no longer shapes grassroots circulation. Through black markets, payment channels, and merchant habits, USDT has in effect replaced the lira. No matter how high inflation runs, no matter how far the currency sinks, the only thing people trust is USDT. Any move by the Turkish government becomes meaningless.”

Roya slowly nodded, her voice tinged with a subtle shock.
“So once this dynamic takes hold, Turkey becomes a full-scale testing ground for a shadow central bank.”

Erkez’s gaze remained calm, yet carried a sharp edge.
“Exactly. It looks voluntary, but public trust is already being steered. The entity that truly controls the funding chain and the conversion rules is waging monetary war—and people don’t even notice.”

**Inserted data points:**

* *2022 Chainalysis report:* Turkey ranked No.1 worldwide in USDT usage, making up around 20% of all crypto transactions.
* *2021:* Turkish lira depreciated about **44%** in a single year; inflation exceeded **36%**; public desire to flee the currency was overwhelming.
* *Black-market premium:* At times, the gap between black-market and official rates reached **20–30%**, revealing that trust had clearly shifted away from official channels.

Erkez turned back to Roya, speaking softly.
“That is the true force of shadow money—legal, tradable, commanding public trust entirely, yet never crossing the red line of the law.”

Roya drew in a quiet breath.
“So if someone were to inject capital from behind the scenes, they could effectively manipulate the entire monetary circulation system.”

Erkez nodded.
“Precisely. Once the funding chain stabilizes and reliance on the lira collapses, the government can do nothing but watch its currency devalue.”











In the evening, Erkez and Roya sat in the study, each holding notes and printed reports. On the screen, charts from his novel showed Turkey’s economic data alongside the penetration of USDT.

Roya pointed at a passage.
“Here—you wrote that the public abandoned the lira and turned to USDT. Is that actually true?”

Flipping through the documents, Erkez answered calmly.
“Almost entirely true. Both official and black-market exchange rates are recorded in detail. Public behavior on exchanges and OTC platforms is openly trackable.”

Roya pressed on.
“Then if USDT lowers its exchange rate, the lira really depreciates?”

Erkez’s gaze stayed steady.
“The only reference point for the public is the USDT rate. Black-market caps and the official rate can’t stop trust from shifting completely. As you can see in the transaction-volume chart, grassroots circulation has already formed a shadow payment system.”

**Inserted data points:**

* *2022 Chainalysis:* Turkey ranked No.1 globally in USDT transaction share.
* *2021–2022:* Official lira rate fell by over **40%**, while the black-market premium hovered around **20–30%**.
* *Merchants and payments:* Multiple online vendors began pricing directly in USDT, and payment platforms started pegging services to it.

Roya studied him quietly, then spoke in a low voice.
“So this is what you mean in your novel by a shadow central bank? The public uses it willingly, but in truth they’re completely controlled.”

Erkez gave a faint smile.
“Exactly. Legal, transparent, tradable—yet it seizes control of public trust and monetary circulation. That’s what makes monetary warfare truly lethal.”











Night deepened, and under the study’s warm light, Erkez handed Roya a freshly printed chapter.

Roya flipped through the pages, brow slightly furrowed.
“This… if the U.S. really injected funds behind the scenes, and the public follows the USDT rate entirely, what can the Turkish government do?”

Erkez answered casually.
“Almost nothing. Official rates, interventions in the international FX market, even central bank actions—these only affect a few large transactions. Grassroots volumes and trust have already shifted completely to the shadow system.”

Roya murmured.
“So every step in your novel, though it seems fictional, could actually be replicated in reality—if the funding chain is strong enough and operations remain legal, it can be done.”

Erkez nodded.
“Exactly. The power of a shadow central bank isn’t coercion; it’s trust. People use it to transact—you see only the numbers on the books, while the real manipulators remain hidden behind the scenes.”

Roya turned to a chart.
“Black-market exchange limits? How much lira can an ordinary person convert daily?”

Erkez pointed to the chart.
“Official data and OTC market records show small daily limits for ordinary traders. But if USDT directly allows lira purchases, the whole circulation system is effectively tethered. People have no choice but to follow the USDT rate; even if the official rate doesn’t change, the lira will still depreciate.”

Roya exhaled softly.
“So this isn’t just a novel—it’s an actionable ‘shadow currency tactic.’”

Erkez smiled, though a trace of concern lingered in his eyes.
“Exactly why I write it as fiction. Let readers see the logic and the risks—because the real operation is far more dangerous.”

The room fell quiet, save for the soft tapping of keyboards and the hum of the printer. Both understood: the Turkish story in the novel was both allegory and rehearsal—the question of whether reality will replicate this path depends on invisible forces.











## **Chapter Five: Arguments and Silence**

Afternoon sunlight filtered through the study curtains, scattering across the desk where papers, notes, and flowcharts lay in disarray.

Roya looked up, her voice low but urgent.
“Erkez, what you’re writing… do you realize? This isn’t just a novel—it will destroy our future. I want to change Iran. I want it to move toward secularism and the rule of law. But you… you’re only writing conspiracy stories.”

Erkez lowered his head slightly, remaining silent. His fingers tapped the keyboard without making a sound. A Turkish-American, third-generation immigrant, he still felt a deep connection to Turkey—especially to its monetary sovereignty. He knew that if the currency operations he depicted in the novel were replicated in reality, it could ultimately render the lira uncirculatable, effectively nullifying national sovereignty. This worry prevented him from casually explaining; all he could do was remain silent.

Roya, an Iranian-American second-generation immigrant, held high hopes for Iran’s future. She grew up in the Iranian community in Los Angeles, with parents adhering strictly to religious traditions, while she had fully secularized. Her secret dream was that one day Iran could, like the U.S., modernize through rule of law and institutional checks and balances. But the complexities of Islam and geopolitics meant that America’s system could not be directly copied—any attempt risked violating international political and religious boundaries.

Erkez’s inner monologue: He knew that during its period of strength, the U.S. would never allow any country to “fully replicate” its system—this was almost tantamount to rebellion. He could neither shatter Roya’s dreams nor directly influence the fates of Iran or Turkey. All he could do was simulate possible paths through his novel, using logic and data to anticipate U.S. and global monetary actions.

Roya spoke again, her voice tinged with helplessness.
“Your silence… is it because you know I’ll oppose you? Or… because you never intended to explain?”

Erkez only shook his head slightly, continuing to stare at the flowcharts and drafts on the desk. He felt a profound loneliness—not just the solitude of writing, but the isolation of caring about Turkey’s fate and the helplessness of being unable to address Roya’s concerns about Iran’s future.

The room quieted, leaving only the faint echoes of keystrokes and the hum of the printer. Roya lowered her head to continue organizing her interview plans. Each was busy in their own way, yet both understood: silence, too, is a form of communication. Between the novel and reality lies a crack—and they could only observe, think, and wait from either side.












## **Secrets and Distance**

Roya sat on the corner sofa in the study, her laptop open to an interview plan. She looked up at Erkez, her voice tinged with reproach.
“You always say you write novels to simulate risks, but you never tell me the truth… We’re a couple—why can’t you be honest with me?”

Erkez paused his typing and let out a soft sigh.
“Roya, I understand how you feel, but there are things I simply cannot say. Even if we are a couple, it doesn’t mean I have the right to disclose government secrets I’ve encountered.”

He pointed at the draft on the screen.
“Just like in the story I’m writing, I can only hint at or simulate potential risks through a ‘pseudo-novel.’ If I spelled everything out, it would no longer be a novel—it would directly imply that the government acknowledges certain logics exist. Such statements carry far more weight than you or I could imagine.”

Roya’s expression showed some disappointment, but she held back her complaint.

Erkez continued, his tone calm but firm.
“In the U.S., there’s something called ‘Spousal Privilege.’ In certain cases, spouses can withhold information from government investigations. But we aren’t married, so this exemption doesn’t apply to unmarried partners. In other words, if you want to know the details I hold, you can only speculate.”

He shook his head lightly and added,
“Even someone like Snowden didn’t tell his girlfriend Lindsay Mills before going public. That’s reality: it’s not that you don’t want to tell, sometimes you simply cannot.”

Roya looked at him quietly, her eyes a mix of understanding and helplessness. Sunlight and shadow fell across them, the air filled with a silent tension—two hearts close, yet unable to fully connect because of the constraints of reality.

Erkez returned to his laptop, fingers dancing across the keyboard again. Each keystroke was a reminder to himself: even if he cannot speak openly, he can still simulate potential future risks through his novel, allowing the world to grasp the truths he observes in another way.









Erkez closed his laptop, took a deep breath, and looked at Roya, his gaze gentle yet apologetic.
“I know you wish I could tell you more, but some things—even if I once had access—can only be partially known. Much of the information must be inferred on your own.”

Roya furrowed her brow slightly.
“Inferred? But what if your inference is wrong?”

Erkez shook his head, his tone calm.
“Even if the inference is correct, the system won’t admit it openly. Look, a country’s operation always has two layers: the surface and the core. Everyone can see the surface, but the core can only be sensed when the system is truly running. We can speculate about the core, but if a country openly acknowledges something, it only means the original core has been updated and a new surface has replaced the old one.”

He paused briefly, then continued.
“The American system is never fixed. No matter how stable state capitalism runs in China, Germany, or Russia, if the U.S. discovers a better model, it will study, modify, and optimize until it’s fully implemented. America is an open system—it refuses to close itself off. It doesn’t worship its institutions or culture as scripture just because it’s a hegemon. Anyone, any country, has a chance to challenge the U.S.; if there’s a new method, America will absorb it, adapt it, and subdue the rival.”

Roya looked at him quietly, as if trying to grasp the meaning behind every word. She whispered,
“So when you write your novels, it’s not just about hinting at risks—it’s about helping us understand the core, rather than only seeing the surface.”

Erkez nodded.
“Exactly. A novel can safely present the possibilities of the core, letting us understand potential risks without directly entering forbidden territory.”

Silence returned to the study, broken only by the soft tapping of the keyboard. Roya leaned back in her chair, her gaze gradually softening. Erkez continued typing, aware that this unavoidable distance—between what can be said and what must remain hidden—was the tension inherent between reality and emotion.










Erkez put down his laptop and turned to Roya, his tone as gentle as he could make it.
“You know, all these stories—at their core—actually come from China’s Alipay. When the U.S. saw it, they realized it could be adapted—a model capable of tracking everyone’s real-name transactions and controlling economic activity.”

Roya frowned.
“Isn’t that terrifying? Almost omniscient control?”

Erkez nodded lightly.
“Exactly. The temptation of such a tool is immense because it approaches omniscience—but the danger is just as great. Omniscience means there is no gray space left, and society’s capacity for innovation trends toward zero.”

He paused, his tone carrying a hint of gravity.
“That’s why USDT can never circulate within the U.S. itself; it can only operate overseas. As long as America doesn’t audit it, almost no other country could truly audit this company either.”

Roya asked,
“And if it became reality, what would happen?”

Erkez’s gaze grew deeper.
“If it comes true, the dollar wouldn’t need to circulate outside the U.S. anymore. All dollars circulating abroad would be USDT. That means when dollars flow back to the U.S., USDT could unilaterally buy massive amounts of U.S. mid- and long-term Treasury bonds without worrying about a run.”

He sighed, eyes resting on Roya.
“I write novels not to promote this model, but to help us understand its potential and risks. To know it could happen—but without touching it—because even we couldn’t withstand it if it did.”

Roya sat quietly, half understanding, half puzzled. She watched Erkez’s fingers tap the keyboard, as if each keystroke hinted at future potential crises—and at the same time, expressed the delicate, fragile trust between them.










Roya blinked.
“So… if it actually succeeds, the U.S. wouldn’t need other countries to voluntarily buy its Treasury bonds anymore?”

Erkez nodded, his tone low and deliberate.
“Exactly. Think back to the gold-dollar and petrodollar systems—back then, the U.S. still relied on other countries to buy Treasuries. Now, once the USDT model is fully operational, America no longer needs anyone’s consent.”

He paused, fingers still on the keyboard.
“It can ‘help’ certain countries buy U.S. mid- and long-term Treasuries directly, without their approval. Today, when the U.S. lets these countries buy, it’s only short-term Treasuries—a gesture, nothing more. True power lies in controlling the issuance of all Treasuries and the flow of funds, while using USDT to manipulate exchange rates and liquidity, leaving the other side powerless to intervene.”

Roya fell silent for a few seconds, then asked softly,
“And Turkey? Is it still just a testing ground?”

A flicker of complexity passed through Erkez’s eyes.
“Turkey is just a reference for experiments. Every step must be careful, or it risks exposing core strategies. The Turkey in the novel exists to help us understand the possibilities—the real operational targets might be entirely different.”

He tapped a few keys gently.
“Understanding this logic is the only way to see the real strategy behind stablecoins—not just currency, but an integrated tool for Treasuries, fiscal policy, and international politics.”

Roya watched the words appear on the screen, her breathing slightly quickened.
“This… isn’t really a novel anymore, is it?”

Erkez gave a faint smile, tinged with resignation.
“Exactly because it feels so real, it must be written as fiction. In reality, speaking it aloud would be the same as admitting it—we can’t operate it openly.”











Erkez paused his typing and turned to Roya.
“You can think of it like China’s e-commerce wars—Alipay and WeChat Pay initially entered the market by pouring in their own funds to shape user habits. Market share was established first, then a monopoly gradually formed.”

Roya frowned slightly.
“But that’s just commercial competition, not a state-level currency war, right?”

Erkez shook his head.
“The difference is scale. The capital behind USDT is backed by state-level power. The U.S. doesn’t need to show the money on its books—on the surface, it’s just corporate operations, but behind it is the credibility of the U.S. state apparatus, military support, and the financial system. Every injection of funds into the market means the opponent faces an unstoppable pressure.”

He pointed at the text on the screen describing the Turkish scenario.
“Imagine the Turkish people voluntarily exchanging lira for USDT, with black-market exchange rates rendered ineffective under USDT control. What can the government do? Intervene with foreign currency? Their reserves are automatically offset behind USDT issuance. Every step you imagine, the U.S. has already calculated the response path.”

Roya bit her lip and asked softly,
“What if a country tries to resist?”

Erkez sighed lightly.
“In a real currency war, every country must first weigh its own strength. Turkey is just a reference; before other countries resist, they must understand—facing state-level U.S. operations, the cost of resistance could be risking national sovereignty. Writing Turkey in the novel shows readers the logic; in reality, the target might be entirely different, but the principle is the same.”

He returned to his laptop.
“The U.S., through USDT, controls not only currency circulation, but also Treasury purchasing rights, financial leverage, and international payment chains. Every fund injection, every exchange rate adjustment, is part of a full-scale calculation.”

Roya stared at the screen, her voice low.
“So this is why you write novels—to make people understand, yet prevent direct execution.”

Erkez gave a faint smile and typed the final line.
“Exactly. Understanding the full logic is enough. Real actions are always hidden behind appearances.”









Erkez leaned back quietly in his chair, gazing into Roya’s eyes.
“You want to know how USDT controls exchange rates? The core lies in its ability to allow lira to be used for direct purchases.”

Roya frowned slightly.
“Direct purchases? Wouldn’t that be illegal?”

Erkez shook his head.
“On the surface, it’s just a digital product issued by a company, not official currency. You buy one USDT, and they use a dollar to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. The whole operation looks like Turks are voluntarily exchanging currency, but in reality, secret U.S. funds, allocated through Congress, are directly injected into the market.”

He tapped his laptop a few times, pointing at the screen.
“Suppose Turks want to exchange dollars at black-market rates. USDT allows them to buy directly with lira, creating a new exchange rate signal. People will see the USDT rate as more trustworthy than the official or black-market rate. The market naturally adjusts trading behavior to follow the USDT price—this is effectively a shadow central bank.”

Roya asked in surprise,
“Can the Turkish government intervene?”

Erkez spoke calmly.
“Impossible. No country can verify the true source of these transactions. If USDT declares a rate, the market accepts it. To devalue the lira, you just need to buy Treasury bonds aggressively. The market sees the surge in exchange volume and assumes lira devaluation is inevitable.”

He added,
“Every step is predictable because the entire U.S. state apparatus backs it. Verification? Impossible. Auditing? Impossible. The rate you see is the rate USDT declares—any resistance is futile.”

Roya was silent for a moment, then whispered,
“So that’s why you write novels… to make people understand the logic, but no one dares to try it in reality.”

Erkez smiled.
“Exactly. Understanding the full picture and recognizing the risk is enough.”










**The Birth of a Shadow Central Bank**

Erkez picked up his laptop and opened the draft chapter he had written.
“Look, this is the Turkish scenario I depicted in the novel.”

Roya leaned against the edge of the sofa, her eyes fixed on the screen.
“Alright, I want to hear how the people gradually shifted to USDT.”

Erkez pointed to the charts on the screen.
“First, the Turkish economy is already mired in inflation and currency volatility. The official lira has almost lost its reference value in both the black market and international markets. People, seeking to protect their assets, started looking for stable hedging tools.”

Roya nodded.
“So they spontaneously started buying USDT?”

Erkez shook his head.
“On the surface it seems spontaneous, but there are actually two core factors behind it: First, secret U.S. funds are injected to buy Treasury bonds, ensuring that USDT can always be redeemed for dollars. Second, USDT allows direct purchases with lira, and each exchange is observed by the market as a signal for the exchange rate.”

He paused and tapped on the keyboard.
“The market sees the USDT rate as higher and more stable than the black-market rate. People naturally follow it. Gradually, both the official and black-market rates lose significance. The USDT price becomes the de facto reference for the lira—this is how a shadow central bank is formed.”

Roya murmured,
“So, the lira is still circulating, but its value depends entirely on USDT?”

Erkez nodded gently.
“Exactly. You think the lira you see can still freely convert to dollars? Impossible. When USDT lowers its rate, people believe the lira is devaluing. The Turkish government’s interventions in the international currency market have no effect.”

He looked up at Roya, calm but with a note of warning.
“Do you understand? For the Turkish public, it feels like a voluntary choice, but in reality, they’ve already become clients of the shadow central bank. U.S. secret funds, allocated through Congress, directly buy Treasury bonds, supporting the value of USDT and ensuring that every rate adjustment is adopted by the market.”

Roya bit her lip and asked softly,
“So… does the Turkish government have any way to respond?”

Erkez shook his head.
“Impossible. No country has the right to audit or verify it. The exchange rate signal you see is the rate USDT sets. Behind the operation is the full support of the U.S. state apparatus and secret funding. People only see the stablecoin rate, unaware that all of this is a highly planned form of market psychological control.”

He set the laptop down and looked out the window.
“That’s why I write novels—not to cause panic, but to make people understand that beneath the surface of a national economy lies a path that could change the entire monetary system—just like USDT’s penetration in Turkey today.”

Roya was silent for a moment, then whispered,
“So… your so-called pseudo-novel is actually a shadow of what could happen in reality.”

Erkez smiled.
“Exactly. That’s what I want readers to grasp: understand the risks, understand the logic—but no one dares to replicate it casually.”










**Living Under a Shadow Central Bank**

The next morning, Roya was reviewing reports on Turkish citizens’ cryptocurrency usage on her laptop.

Roya frowned and asked,
“Erkez, this shadow central bank you mentioned… how much does it affect people’s daily lives?”

Erkez sipped his coffee quietly.
“You think it’s just digital transactions? Look at this.” He opened a chart showing USDT trading volumes across Turkish cities alongside the lira’s fluctuations in black-market and official exchange rates.

“Whenever the USDT rate drops, people feel the pressure of lira devaluation and immediately adjust their daily spending and savings. Businesses also modify prices and wages according to USDT rates, and banks have no choice but to follow customer preferences. In practice, USDT has already become a de facto shadow central bank.”

Roya pressed on,
“And the official rate? Can they intervene?”

Erkez shook his head.
“No chance. The market signals are already monopolized by USDT. Official rates and international market interventions fail. Even black-market rates merely adjust following USDT changes; people recognize only the USDT price.”

He pointed to the curves on the screen.
“Every USDT-to-lira transaction is backed by funds injected through U.S. congressional appropriations to directly purchase Treasury bonds, ensuring USDT’s unlimited exchange capacity. In theory, the U.S. can freely adjust the USDT price, controlling the pace of lira depreciation or appreciation, and the Turkish government cannot interfere.”

Roya thought for a moment, then asked softly,
“So, people feel they’re making voluntary choices, but their economic fate is actually fully controlled by USDT?”

Erkez nodded.
“Exactly. They think they’re protecting their assets, but every step is within our logic. Citizens’ behavior is guided, and businesses, banks, and official policies are forced to comply. That is the power of the shadow central bank.”

Roya looked up at Erkez.
“When you wrote this chapter, was it just to help readers understand the risk, or…?”

Erkez smiled faintly.
“It’s both understanding the risk and a warning. Understanding how the U.S. uses digital tools to control the economy—this is both a novel and an alert. People feel they have freedom of choice, but the logic behind it has already been locked in.”

He returned to his laptop and typed, continuing to depict the daily life of Turks in the story: small shop owners adjusting prices due to USDT rate changes, cafés calculating raw material costs daily based on USDT exchange rates, schools starting to price tuition in USDT… every mundane scenario revealed the subtle influence of the shadow central bank.

Roya watched the screen silently, whispering,
“This… seems more thorough than I imagined.”

Erkez answered softly,
“It has to be thorough; otherwise, a shadow central bank cannot establish de facto authority.”










**Arguments and Silence**

In the study that afternoon, sunlight slanted across the laptop keyboard. Roya looked up, her eyes filled with confusion and anxiety.
“Erkez, what you’ve written… does it mean human freedom still exists? Or is everything already controlled?”

Erkez put down his hands and took a deep breath.
“Freedom still exists, but its scope is very specific—only within sovereignty.”

Roya frowned.
“What do you mean?”

Erkez pointed to the manuscript on the screen.
“USDT can directly alter a country’s economic order outside its sovereignty, manipulating exchange rates and controlling the flow of capital. In countries under its reach, citizens, businesses, even governments cannot be truly free. What you think of as market choice or currency freedom is already controlled by the shadow central bank.”

He paused, then continued,
“But freedom inside the U.S. operates differently—a kind of ‘project-king’ freedom. To gain freedom, one must map out a blueprint, propose a path, and execute a plan. America encourages risk-taking and innovation, but the vast majority of countries and people lack this logic. The freedom they pursue is a combination of financial independence and convenience—they are unwilling to take risks or create new systems.”

Roya spoke softly,
“So the novel you’re writing is really showing a contrast between two kinds of freedom?”

Erkez nodded.
“Yes. The future of state capitalism looks like this: within sovereignty, project-driven capitalism still operates freely. But outside sovereignty, the economy runs under USDT or similar shadow tools. Freedom becomes a privilege, while the vast majority of countries and people can only live within pre-established rules.”

He moved closer to the window, gazing into the distance.
“When this model fully runs, anyone willing to take risks has only one choice—to come to America. American-style freedom becomes a privilege, and the rest of the world must follow the shadow rules. Humanity must face reality: the freedom you imagine and the freedom America promotes are fundamentally different.”

Roya fell silent. Her eyes reflected a flicker of understanding, mixed with unease.
“So… in the future world, capitalism still exists?”

Erkez returned to his desk, fingers tapping the keyboard.
“Capitalism continues to operate within sovereignty, but beyond it, it has become state capitalism—a system jointly controlled by states, shadow institutions, and shadow capital. Freedom, markets, and risk… all are redefined.”

The study fell into a brief silence, broken only by the soft tapping of keys and the rustling of leaves in the distant wind.











## **Chapter Six: The Shadow of a Former Colleague**

A small old café in Washington, by the window. When Erkez pushed open the door, he could almost smell the lingering mix of ink and coffee in the air. It was the place where he and his former supervisor—once also a close friend—used to meet.

He slid his laptop across the table and gently turned it toward the other man.
“Take a look at these chapters.”

The former supervisor read in silence for over ten minutes, his brows tightening more than once. Only after closing the laptop did he finally look up, his eyes complicated as they met Erkez’s.
“You’re out of your mind. If anyone else had written this, I’d call it a joke—at most, some conspiracy theory. But coming from you, I have to take it seriously.”

Erkez gave a faint smile, offering no reply.

The former supervisor tapped lightly on the table, as though weighing his words.
“You know, some things, once written down, blur the line. The problem is… you’re writing this as a novel.”

Erkez answered calmly,
“Yes. A novel. Legal, public. No one can say I’m leaking secrets.”

For a brief moment, the café’s background music seemed distant.

Finally, the supervisor spoke.
“Fine then, write it. It’s just a novel after all. But remember this—every line you write will be taken seriously by certain people.”

He stood, ready to leave, then paused and turned back.
“You think you’re writing fiction. But others will know you’re actually declassifying and dramatizing certain pathways. Be clear about that.”

Erkez replied softly,
“Of course I know.”

As his friend’s silhouette melted into the stream of cars on the street outside, Erkez lowered his gaze to the laptop screen. A cold realization brushed over him: the novel wasn’t fantasy. It was simply clothed in a legal disguise.

**Inner Monologue:**
Writing it as a novel keeps me from being accused of leaking secrets. The CIA’s Prepublication Review Board (PRB) looms over every former employee—anyone wanting to publish a memoir must submit for review. Snowden’s *Permanent Record*, John Kiriakou’s memoir—they all went through that gauntlet, some even sued, redacted, censored. Fiction is the only loophole—it’s not testimony, not a report, not an admission. It’s only “imagination.” In American legal logic, fiction can exist. Reality cannot.

He knew: this was both his shield—and his blade.












## **Chapter Seven: The Crack in Love**

Night fell over Washington, D.C. Streetlights filtered through the blinds of the study, casting hard, cold grids across the wall.

Roya closed her laptop and walked over to Erkez, her eyes burning with a long-suppressed anger and disappointment.

“Why are you writing this book—do you want to expose the truth, or are you trying to protect something?” Her voice was low, but edged with steel.

Erkez paused at the keyboard. After a moment of silence, he replied,
“I’m writing this so that we can still have a future.”

Roya froze, as if she hadn’t understood. She had always thought she was the one desperately searching for the future. Yet in Erkez’s eyes, the so-called “future” was something vaster, unseen, beyond her reach.

“You’re writing this to protect Turkey?” she finally pressed. “Or just to comfort yourself?”

The air grew heavy. Erkez’s hand hovered above the keyboard but did not fall. He looked at Roya, unable to give the answer she wanted.

Her gaze grew colder.
“Why can’t you be like a real whistleblower? Why can’t you stand up and tell the world?”

Another name flashed through her mind—**Daniel Ellsberg**.

In 1971, the *Pentagon Papers* were made public, exposing years of lies behind the Vietnam War. America shook, the White House trembled. But Ellsberg paid the price—prosecuted, nearly condemned to spend life in prison.

“Ellsberg dared to expose the truth.” Roya’s voice carried a sharp challenge. “Why don’t you dare?”

Erkez shook his head, his expression not defiant but unnervingly calm, almost cold.
“Ellsberg nearly spent his whole life in a cell. Do you really want me to take that road?”

Roya was struck silent. In that instant she realized—beyond her hunger for revelation and action, Erkez had chosen a different, more ambiguous path: fiction.

Fiction blurred the line between truth and imagination.
Fiction could never stand as courtroom evidence, yet it could leave behind hints.
Fiction also widened the distance between them.

The room fell into a long silence, broken only by the city’s night breeze stirring the curtains—witness to the growing crack between them.











Roya kept staring at him, waiting for an answer that could ease her heart.

At last, Erkez spoke, his voice slow and measured:
“You need to understand something—this isn’t leaking secrets. True leaking is when the government has already drawn up a plan, even begun to execute it, and I expose it. That was Ellsberg’s path. But I don’t have any ‘Pentagon Papers.’ I don’t hold a single sheet of orders written in black and white.”

He paused before continuing:
“What I can do is piece together certain trends, certain logics. Right now, these things remain at the stage of academic discussion and model projections. They’re nowhere near implementation.”

Roya’s brow stayed furrowed, though a trace of doubt flickered in her eyes.

“Think about it,” Erkez lifted his head, meeting her gaze.
“If capitalism really is to transform into state capitalism, it can’t happen through a single executive order. It’s a self-evolving process of a complex system. It would involve Congress, the Treasury, Wall Street, even the interests of multinational corporations. None of them would easily give way.”

“You mean—” Roya probed cautiously, “even America itself isn’t ready?”

Erkez let out a quiet breath, as if shedding a burden:
“Exactly. Is America ready to take off the mask and openly rule the globe? No one can say. The rewards would be enormous, but the risks even greater. This model—let’s just say it has been proposed, it has been studied, but it’s still far from execution.”

He paused, then added:
“I write it as a novel not to avoid responsibility, but so you can see what kind of future might emerge. If the day ever comes, you won’t dismiss it all as just another conspiracy theory.”

Roya didn’t respond right away. Her eyes shimmered faintly in the dim light, as if struggling to absorb his words.











Roya finally lifted her head, her eyes glistening faintly red, no longer trying to suppress her emotions.

“Erkez, do you know?” Her voice trembled with a kind of tragic resolve.
“It’s not that I don’t understand your logic, or that I can’t see you’re protecting yourself. But there’s always been a thorn in my heart—you say all of this is still just academic debate, model projections… so what? The people in Iran, the people in Turkey, they’re already paying the price today. Their money loses value every single day, their children are born already condemned to carry a crushing life. I can’t wait for some future projection—I need the present.”

She paused, her emotions rising sharper, her gaze burning with that distinctive Persian blend of romance and sorrow:
“I thought you were writing this book to become the outcry of our generation, like *The Pentagon Papers*, piercing lies with truth. But now you’re telling me it’s just a model? Just academic theory? Then what am I? Did I follow you all the way here just to watch you sketch out a future that may never arrive, only on paper?”

Her tone carried both a plea and an accusation. She wasn’t shouting in anger, but every word landed heavy in the air, weighted like stones.










Erkez looked at her quietly, without answering right away. The only light in the room came from the faint glow of the keyboard. His fingers tapped lightly against the desk, yet no words appeared.

He knew he was losing her trust, but he also understood that once the truth was spoken, their world could never return to what it was.

—What she longed for was a kind of romantic courage.
—What he held in his hands was nothing but naked coldness.

At last, he drew in a deep breath and spoke slowly:

“Roya, you’ve always been searching for happiness, searching for the future. But have you ever thought—can happiness really belong to everyone? Can every desire truly be fulfilled at the same time?”

His voice was quiet, yet carried an inescapable weight:

“What do Iranians want? Many of them don’t actually wish for secularization. Their real desire is for Islam to build a new second Arab empire. If you push for secular politics, you won’t just face a handful of zealots—you’ll face more than half of all Iranians, including your own parents. You think they’re merely conservative? No. They know very well what they are choosing.”

Roya’s breath faltered for a moment, as if to argue back, but his next words pressed down on her:

“And Turkey? Do you know what the word *Turk* originally means? Silk. From the beginning, the Turks survived by controlling the trade nodes along the Silk Road. Today is no different. To control the nodes is to hold the lifeline. Do you remember why Europe launched the Age of Exploration? Because the Silk Road was controlled—they sought to reclaim the initiative.”

He looked at her, his tone firmer than before:

“Don’t imagine them all as victims waiting to be saved. Every nation pursues its own greatest interest. The Iran you want may not be the Iran they want; the future you long for may not be the future they long for.”











Roya held her breath, staring at him, her eyes tinged red with grievance and anger. She struggled to find the right words, but for a moment, nothing came.

At last, she spoke, her voice trembling:

“So in your eyes, everything is just interest? The faith of Iranians, the history of Turkey, even the feelings between us—are they all just calculations? If the future is nothing but a cold balance of interests, then is love also just interest?”

Her words cut straight into Erkez’s chest like a knife.

He opened his mouth, wanting to explain, but her emotions pressed forward and silenced him.

“You say Iranians want an empire—so their dream should be respected? You say Turkey wants to control the nodes—so other nations’ roads must be severed? And what about me? The future I want, the Iran I want—should it be swallowed up just because it doesn’t match the majority’s will?”

Her voice grew louder, yet still controlled—not a scream, but carrying the tragic cadence of a Persian poem:

“You always speak as if fate is inevitable. But in my heart, freedom means someone must stand up—even if they stand alone—to tell the world: we don’t want destiny, we want choice. Even if we fail, we cannot do nothing.”

By the time she reached the end, her gaze softened, though it made her words cut even deeper:

“If even you choose only to coldly calculate, instead of standing up and choosing… then how can I still walk this path with you?”











Erkez looked at her quietly, a flicker of pain in his eyes, before he finally spoke slowly:

“It’s not about interest, Roya. It’s about structure.”

He paused, trying to let her emotions settle. “Love has passion, yes—but it also has structure. Only when the structure is solid can emotions be constantly renewed. Otherwise, no matter how fierce the passion, it burns out like fireworks—brilliant for a moment, then gone. You and I have seen countless films and dramas, but the ones that truly move people are often the outlaw-lovers, the Bonnie-and-Clyde kind of love. They’re not just lovers; they’re allies in battle. I’m not saying we have to imitate their life-and-death devotion, but we must understand this: lasting emotion requires lasting structure.”

His voice softened, but it carried a calm firmness:

“Iran’s problem, at its core, is the clash between theocracy and rational governance. When the United States was founded, its *Farewell Address* was not just a farewell to a man, but to an old world, an old order. It was a farewell to state religion, a turn toward rational governance. That was the path of continuous structural refinement. America’s pluralism, in essence, is competitive—different religious sects function like publicly listed companies, competing for believers and resources, but in the process, they drive institutional improvement.”

Erkez lifted his head, meeting her eyes:

“If rational governance is to take root in the Middle East, it can’t simply copy the models of the U.S., China, or Russia. It must innovate, it must build a new model of structural stability. And our relationship is the same. It has to withstand conflict, it needs a framework that binds us together—not just a lone, burning courage that consumes itself.”

He let out a sigh, his tone softening:

“Roya, creating a new model—that’s our future. That’s the true foundation of our relationship’s stability. But before we can move toward a new model, we must first see clearly the inner workings of the U.S., China, and Russia. Otherwise, we don’t even have a starting point for imitation.”











Roya listened in silence, her eyes glistening faintly. The metaphor of “love and structure” had touched her, softening her heart for a brief moment. But then she bit her lip, her voice carrying a trace of defiance:

“Structure… I understand what you mean.” She shook her head gently, her tone trembling. “But Erkez, if everything is just about structure, then what about those political dissidents who fled to Europe and America? They have no structure, no safety net. All they have is passion, conviction, and a single untimely truth—and for that, they’re forced into exile.”

She lifted her gaze, her eyes shining with a stubborn light. “Many of them may never return home for the rest of their lives. They see themselves as sparks, hoping to ignite the future. But by your logic, are they all failures? Just because they lack structure—are they doomed to be forgotten?”

She drew a deep breath, her voice taking on a sudden, tragic weight:

“And what about us? The second generation, the third generation of immigrants—caught between America and our homelands. Are we supposed to stand by coldly, simulating institutional evolution through novels? If that’s truly the case, then what makes us different from those dissidents? At least they are a living outcry, while we—are nothing more than self-consolation written in words.”












Erkez gazed out the window, his expression calm yet heavy with thought. When he finally spoke, his tone carried the sharp edge of logic:

“Roya, you see—that’s the difference. America only recognizes structure. Anyone can claim to have dreams, to paint a beautiful vision. And then what? Without a verifiable path, it’s all just empty talk.”

He turned back, his eyes settling on her. “Even a presidential candidate can make sweeping promises during a campaign. But if, before the midterms, the public sees no verifiable path, if those promises can’t be delivered, they fall into the trap of becoming a lame-duck president.”

Erkez drew a deep breath, his voice firmer now: “Those who can’t provide a path—at best—become political exiles. What America offers them is freedom of speech, but never political capital. Most are trapped in a closed loop, mistaking the act of sketching dreams and criticizing authority for a future chance at governance. Reality doesn’t allow such dreams to stand alone. It only acknowledges structures, paths that can be tested, verified, and sustained.”

He lowered his head slightly, his voice softening: “The dissidents you admire—their courage is undeniable. But without structure, without a path, their outcries remain isolated voices, destined to be drowned out by the tides of history.”











Roya clutched her laptop tightly, her fingers trembling slightly. Her gaze lingered on Erkez, a mixture of anger and defiance in her eyes. She spoke in a low voice:

“You’re always talking about structure and path. But… isn’t love, ideals, and the struggle of political exiles itself the proof that people dare to dream? If you place everything under the weight of reason, does that mean you’re denying the courage of human beings who risk everything for their beliefs?”

She paused, took a deep breath, her voice carrying that uniquely Persian sense of tragic grandeur:

“You say they are nothing more than isolated voices. But have you ever considered—that those isolated voices are the beginning of a storm? Even if they ultimately fail, they still change the people around them, if only by sparking a moment of awakening.”

Roya looked straight at Erkez, her eyes flickering with conflicting emotions. “You think structure and path can explain everything. But what I see is the human passion that can never be fully confined by calculation. I want you to understand—I’m not questioning you, and I’m not rejecting reason. I just… I don’t want our lives, our future, to be consumed entirely by the merciless logic of reality.”

Slowly, she lowered her head, her voice soft yet tinged with sorrow:

“I want to believe that—even if reason tells me it’s impossible—I can still fight for my ideals, and for love.”











Erkez leaned lightly against the desk, his fingertips tapping gently on the edge of the laptop. His voice was calm yet resolute:

“Roya, I wrote this novel not to preach, and not to make anyone obey. I only lay out the path, draw the trend with clarity.”

He paused, his eyes settling on her face, a trace of helplessness in his tone:

“You must understand—I never said I liked this structure. It’s… too rigid. So rigid that the world beyond sovereignty has turned into a lifeless sea. People think freedom still exists, but in truth, freedom survives only within their borders.”

He let out a quiet sigh, his voice softening:

“I only want you to see that this path exists, that the trend is irreversible. But to like it? I never have.”











Erkez stared quietly at the laptop screen, his fingers hovering lightly over the keyboard, yet pressing no keys. His voice was low and measured:

“Roya, you must understand, my resignation, writing this book—it all belongs to emotion, to passion.”

He leaned back slightly in his chair and let out a sigh:

“To outsiders, it appears calm, orderly, logically complete, a path seemingly calculated—but that is merely a veil of strategy and rational logic. A veil for what? A veil for the truest feelings within me.”

His gaze drifted to the shifting light outside the window, as if he could see the future path he had drawn slowly flowing before him:

“What you see is reason, but behind reason lies my choices made in emotion. Every word, every page, carries my anxiety, my loneliness, my passion… yet the surface is hidden beneath logic and reasoning, so outsiders cannot see through it.”












Roya furrowed her brow slightly, a complex mix of emotions flickering across her eyes—both frustration and a trace of being moved. She slowly walked to the window, gazing out at the streets of Washington, as if searching for answers, or perhaps sorting through her own thoughts.

“So,” she said softly, her voice trembling slightly, “you’ve always been using reason to mask emotion… You write your book so calmly, so methodically, but is it really just to hide your true worries and loneliness?”

She turned to face Erkez directly: “But… even with that explanation, I still feel alone. You write about sovereignty, nations, currency wars—but I can’t step into your world. You roam in logic, and I chase in emotion… it feels like there’s always a barrier between us.”

She bit her lower lip gently, her emotions flaring a little: “I understand your rationality, I’m even drawn to it—but I can’t help thinking—if everything is logic and structure, then what about us? What about love? Does it too have to be bound by logic, losing its freedom?”

Her voice softened, almost like a whisper to herself, yet also an outpouring toward Erkez: “I’m not trying to interfere with your novel. I just hope… that within this calm path you’ve drawn, there’s still a place for me, still room to breathe.”












Erkez let out a faint sigh and looked at Roya, his voice calm yet carrying a subtle undertone: “Roya, a book is just a tool. Few will truly read it, but there will always be some who understand.”

He paused, tapping lightly on the edge of his laptop with his fingers. “You know, when stablecoins emerged, China quickly legislated against them, while simultaneously developing its own stablecoin. Every country has its own logic of response—this is inevitable.”

Leaning back in his chair, his gaze steady and analytical, he continued: “When the real stablecoin war begins, that’s when the currency battlefield truly erupts. Each side delineates its sphere of influence, each tests the limits. You don’t need to be obsessed with a book—the real drama isn’t in the words, but in the reactions of the world afterward. That’s the part that’s truly fascinating.”










Roya furrowed her brow, her lips trembling slightly—partly moved, partly resentful. “You always look at things so calmly, so on a grand scale… but what about ordinary people like us? We have no backing, no data. All we see is the life in front of us, the risks right before our eyes.”

She set down her laptop and leaned back in her chair, her gaze carrying that uniquely Persian mix of romanticism and solemnity. “You write for those who can understand, but what about people like us? Are we just supposed to passively accept the layout of this world?”

Her voice lowered, yet grew more resolute: “I want to know—can your reason, your analysis, give us any chance to choose? Or are we doomed to be mere pieces on a chessboard?”

A few seconds of silence passed. Roya stared at Erkez, as if waiting—waiting for him to answer with a mix of reason, calm, and emotion to meet her challenge.










Erkez took a deep breath and slowly nodded, saying nothing. He knew that in this moment, any explanation would be futile. Ordinary people may harbor dreams, but they never truly act on them—they expect others to pave the path while they simply enjoy the results. Confronted with such a reality, he understood that the only viable response was silence.

He looked at Roya, his gaze carrying a trace of helplessness, yet also a calm clarity—sometimes silence speaks louder than words.









## **Chapter 8: The Shadow of Publication**

Erkez closed his laptop, his fingers still hovering above the keyboard, as if afraid to break some fragile silence in the air. He stared at the screen and took a deep breath, fully aware: this was no ordinary book. Every line of text had been meticulously reasoned, every event subtly aligned with possible real-world scenarios—except he had transformed classified and sensitive data into a “declassified” novel logic.

Roya sat at the desk on the other side of the study, her fingers tapping lightly on her own laptop. She looked up at him: “Are you really planning to publish this? Even as a novel… the content is too close to reality.”

Erkez smiled faintly. “The closer it is to reality, the less likely anyone will truly grasp the full picture. Most people will just treat it as a conspiracy story.”

Roya frowned, closing her laptop and walking over to him. “But what if someone actually understands it? What if those paths are followed by someone…”

He waved his hand slightly, his gaze calm but firm: “That’s the danger of the book, and its purpose. The greater the resistance to publishing, the more sensitive the path it reveals. We cannot change reality, but we can make it visible, letting those with the capability foresee the risks in advance.”

Sunlight slanted through the window, falling across their shoulders like a silent judgment. Roya remained quiet; she knew this book was more than words—it was a warning.

The real data points flashed clearly in Erkez’s mind—Assange’s case, the WikiLeaks incidents. He understood that when information touches a nation’s core interests, even literary interpretation is enough to make publishers and algorithmic systems hesitate.

Roya whispered, “So we can only watch, letting things exist that others don’t want seen?”

Erkez lowered his head, staring at the closed laptop. “Yes. Few will see it—but those few are enough to change the course of events.”












A few weeks later, Erkez and Roya submitted their manuscript to several publishers with eager anticipation. At first, the editors’ feedback warmed their hearts—the manuscript was praised for its clear logic, detailed data, and tight narrative. Roya tapped lightly on her laptop at the desk, a smile tugging at her lips: “See? I told you someone would understand your book.”

But the good times didn’t last. Months passed, and by April 2026, the situation changed abruptly. Emails from editors who had once been enthusiastic began to drag; contract signings were repeatedly delayed. Recommendation algorithms seemed to deliberately ignore their work, search results on online platforms gradually disappeared, and even the book lists they had subscribed to stopped showing their manuscript.

Roya furrowed her brow as she scrolled through the ignored emails, her voice low: “You see, this is the warning… or maybe the resistance.”

Erkez leaned back in his chair, hands clasped over his knees, eyes calm: “This isn’t a conspiracy. Publishing channels and algorithms are systems inherently sensitive to risk. The more dangerous a book is, the more likely it will be filtered out naturally. There’s no need to get angry, or even to explain.”

Roya couldn’t help looking up, her gaze a mix of anger and confusion: “Dangerous? They clearly don’t understand it! Are they really afraid of a novel?”

Erkez shook his head slightly: “No, it’s because the potential readers who could truly understand it are so few. Those who can grasp the paths within will instinctively become alert. That very information gap is itself a form of filtering.”

Roya fell silent, fingers lightly tapping the keyboard. She understood that the resistance to publication was no accident—it was an invisible force preemptively guarding against possible futures.

Sunlight slanted through the window, filling the study with the scent of paper and coffee, like a silent judge observing them. Erkez looked at Roya and spoke softly: “This is the shadow of publication. The danger isn’t in the words themselves, but in the world that comes after someone truly understands them.”











Roya slammed her laptop shut, her eyes blazing with anger and frustration. “This isn’t fair! You’ve spent an entire year writing this book, pouring your heart into it, and yet the whole world seems blind to it! Doesn’t that prove that what you wrote is real?!”

Erkez leaned back in his chair, his gaze calm, as if watching a storm pass. “Roya, reading has a threshold. The people who can truly read, who enjoy reading, who can translate words into complete images in their minds, are very few—about 20%. The rest are mere browsers.”

“But if they don’t read it, doesn’t that mean your book was written for nothing?” Roya bit her lip, anxiety creeping into her voice.

“Not for nothing,” Erkez said slowly, his tone still calm. “Writing a book is never really for the masses—it’s for the AI, for the systems. They are the first to ‘understand’ the logic in the book, to grasp the underlying paths. Being marginalized, ignored by algorithms, that only proves the book’s value within the system has skyrocketed.”

Roya’s brow furrowed, her breathing slightly quickening. “You mean… ordinary people can never understand it, and your book isn’t really meant for them?”

Erkez nodded, fingers tapping lightly on the desk. “Exactly. The information gap is a kind of power. Ordinary people may only see the surface, but the system decodes the core. The fewer who understand the paths, the more it proves the book’s logic is dangerous—and precise.”

Roya looked into Erkez’s eyes. After a moment of silence, her voice softened slightly: “So the purpose of your book isn’t to make the world understand immediately, but to make the system understand first.”

“Yes,” Erkez replied softly, a trace of loneliness in his gaze. “The information gap is the most reliable protection, and the sharpest weapon.”

Sunlight slanted through the window, casting across the desk piled with manuscripts, as if reminding them—the world understands too little, and what truly matters always lies at the edge.












Roya’s brow furrowed, her eyes flashing with anger and anxiety. “You see, this is a conspiracy! This proves your book is real!” Her voice trembled with unease. “Have you… really revealed all the risks? Could someone come after you because of this?”

Erkez gave a faint smile, leaning back in his chair, his gaze calm and profound. “No, this isn’t disclosure—it’s protection. The danger isn’t in the facts themselves, but in the ambiguity of the book. It doesn’t explicitly confirm any national logic, and only those who can decode the information gap will truly understand it.”

He paused, then continued: “The U.S. never declared it would directly rule the world when it had nuclear weapons. Today, it’s impossible to use USDT to take over the monetary issuance of all countries outside the U.S. Being marginalized is intentional—to prevent smaller nations from noticing early. Major powers like China and Russia have certainly noticed and adjusted their policies. A nation without external enemies is a nation on the brink of collapse. The U.S. has the courage to manufacture enemies—that is real institutional confidence. In the past twenty years, every target the U.S. struck was cultivated personally by the CIA.”

Roya’s breath quickened slightly, but she tried to keep calm. “But… what about ordinary people? They’ll only see the story, not the path.”

Erkez tapped lightly on the edge of his laptop. “It’s like Assange and WikiLeaks—the Department of Justice has been hunting him; yet *The Big Short* and *War Dogs* were openly released. Ordinary people only see the surface; very few understand the underlying path. The novel wears a cloak of fiction, the path is hidden, but those who understand will know this is the safest and most effective method.”

Sunlight slanted into the study, illuminating the desk piled with manuscripts. Roya remained silent for a moment, her emotions tangled—anger, anxiety, confusion, yet touched with a hint of awe.











Erkez leaned back in his desk chair, fingers lightly tapping the surface, his gaze resting on the thick stack of manuscripts. The meaning of publication slowly unfolded in his mind:

Ordinary readers can only passively receive the information fed to them. They see the story but cannot perceive the hidden paths between the lines, nor can they proactively identify the risks.

Those who truly grasp the book’s implications are already active within the information network. They can bear the risks and reconstruct the whole picture from the ambiguous clues.

And this shadow—that is precisely why the book exists. The obstacles to publication, the frozen algorithms, the indifferent channels—all of these ensure that the danger affects only those “who are prepared,” allowing the real-world game to continue quietly, operating between appearance and core.

He slowly closed his laptop, silently telling himself: the book is a tool; those who understand it will determine the next phase of the situation.











Roya’s fingers lingered on the laptop keyboard for a few seconds before she looked up at Erkez, a faint trace of anxiety in her eyes. “So… what they fear isn’t the book itself, but the people who can truly understand it, right?”

Erkez nodded slightly, his gaze falling on the scattered manuscript pages on the desk, his voice low and steady: “Exactly. Freezing algorithms, shelving contracts—these are all ways to filter the audience. Ordinary readers can only passively receive information; what they’re allowed to see is almost entirely superficial.”

He reached out and fiddled with a cable at the edge of the laptop, leaning slightly back in his chair, his eyes soft but clear: “Those who truly grasp the book’s hints are already active within the information network. They can bear the risks and know how to act in complex environments. The shadow cast by publication exists to protect them, ensuring that these risks affect only the ‘prepared ones.’”

Roya spoke softly: “But… if someone understands it too early, could they… get caught up in it?”

Erkez paused for a moment, then spoke slowly: “They won’t. Risk doesn’t strike indiscriminately; it only affects those capable of bearing it. Ordinary people, even if they read it, only see the surface story. The information gap is both a barrier and an umbrella of protection.”

He leaned forward slightly, his gaze locking onto Roya’s: “We don’t need the whole world to understand our book—just someone who gets it is enough. Those who do will recognize the risks and know how to use the information without letting the situation spiral out of control.”

Roya closed her eyes and exhaled slowly, her voice tinged with complexity: “So… this book is both a trap and a shield.”

Erkez gave a faint smile, the corner of his mouth tinged with a trace of helplessness: “Exactly. To the outside, it’s a story; internally, it’s a guide.”











Night had fallen over the streets of Washington, and the soft light from the study lamp fell across scattered manuscripts and the laptop screen.

* The two sat in silence. In Roya’s eyes, there was a hint of understanding, mixed with a faint reluctance, as if she were processing the tug-of-war between reality and ideals.
* Erkez gently pulled her into his arms and whispered, “The shadow of publication is protection born from the information gap and ambiguity. Danger only affects those who are meant to bear it.”
* He paused, fingertips brushing the edge of the manuscript: “Those who understand will recognize the risks and know how to respond. Ordinary people see only the surface.”

**Interwoven with real data points:**

* The case of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, with the U.S. Department of Justice relentlessly pursuing the leakers, shows the cost of exposing secrets.

* *The Big Short* and *Lord of War* successfully reached audiences, using a “fictionalized reality” approach that separates entertainment from data, allowing only a select few to decode the information.

* The night wind gently stirred the curtains, and the study’s light cast their long, intertwined shadows, as if the book itself were quietly extending an unknown path into the darkness.












* Night had deepened, and Roya was fast asleep, her breathing steady.

* Erkez sat at the desk, fingers lightly flipping through the recently returned publishing contract.

* He opened his laptop and scanned the day’s news:

  * “South Korea’s foreign exchange shortage worsens; citizens flock en masse to USDT for safety.”

* The numbers flickering across the screen felt like a cold pulse, sending a shiver down his spine.

* He leaned back in his chair, eyes fixed on the screen, murmuring to himself:

  * “Perhaps, the novel I’m writing was never really a novel.”

* The light fell across scattered manuscripts, and the night wind stirred the curtains, as if the future’s path were quietly extending before him.











## **Volume Two: The Internal Narrative of Erkez’s Novel**

### Main Thread:

The internal narrative of Erkez’s novel describes **how Turkey is gradually “taken over” in a seemingly rational way**.

---

### **Chapter One: The Invasion of the Shadow Dollar**

#### **Real Data Points**

* In 2024, Turkey’s annual inflation rate exceeded **60%**.
* The Lira-to-Dollar exchange rate once surpassed **30:1**, hitting a historic low.
* According to on-chain transaction statistics, Turkey ranked **first in global USDT usage**.

#### **Novel Narrative**

Night falls over Istanbul, the Bosphorus breeze sweeping across the docks.
In a café, three young entrepreneurs debate:

> “Should we sign the contract in dollars or lira?”
> “Are you kidding? Even suppliers only accept USDT now.”
> “Clients pay in USDT too—who still dares to use the lira?”

The café owner interjects: “Last month, tax officials audited me. They saw I received USDT, but said nothing—just frowned. Later, I realized—the central bank itself can’t control it anymore.”

The devaluation of the lira felt like a silent plunder. Young people no longer trusted savings; the mobile wallets in their hands had become their trusted “new banks.”

**The shadow dollar (USDT)** completed a transformation in Turkey:

* From a gray-market tool,
* To a necessity for e-commerce and corporate settlements,
* To a “shadow central bank” even tax officials chose to ignore.

#### **Structural Analysis (Erkez’s Narrative Commentary)**

This is not a violent takeover, but a “rational evolution.”
Currency devaluation creates a vacuum, and vacuums must be filled.
When the Turkish central bank chooses to “turn a blind eye,” the shadow dollar becomes legitimized—
No treaties, no wars, only time.

The invasion of the shadow dollar completes the first step:
**The boundaries of monetary sovereignty are quietly rewritten through everyday payments.**










### **Chapter Two: The Dual-Track Currency System**

#### **Real Data Points**

* In 2025, simulations based on IMF and Chainalysis reports showed that **about 40% of domestic payments in Turkey were settled using cryptocurrency**, the vast majority being **USDT**.
* Due to certain U.S. sanctions targeting Turkey, corporate offshore dollar accounts faced freezes or strict scrutiny.
* As a result, cross-border trading companies, energy importers, and electronics wholesalers largely turned to USDT for settlement and value storage.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

At the port of İzmir, containers are stacked like mountains.
A customs officer tells an importer:

> “Your dollar account frozen again? That’s the third time this month.”
> “Exactly, we can’t even pay for the chips.”

The importer sighs and pulls out his mobile wallet:

> “Luckily, there’s USDT. The supplier in Shenzhen can confirm receipt in three minutes.”

Meanwhile, in a real estate company’s meeting room in Ankara, the CFO reports to the board:

* **Salaries**: Still paid in lira, since workers’ daily expenses rely on it.
* **Procurement and loans**: Fully shifted to USDT, as suppliers refuse lira payments.
* **Savings and profits**: Board members demand conversion into stablecoin assets, stored in cold wallets.

The CEO frowns: “So our accounts are dual-currency? Lira on one side, USDT on the other?”
The CFO nods: “Precisely. It’s a dual-track system. Lira buys groceries and pays for taxis, USDT buys the future.”

Young people in the café are discussing too:

> “Lira is just pocket change, like topping up a transit card. Real savings? No one dares to leave it in the bank.”

---

#### **Structural Analysis (Erkez’s Narrative Commentary)**

This is the second stage of the currency war:

1. **Lira** → Forced to degrade into “small-change money,” only for retail and daily expenses.
2. **USDT** → Becomes the “hard currency” for savings and large settlements, with stablecoin wallets replacing bank accounts.

Turkey’s monetary system thus develops a fissure:

* On paper, it remains the single sovereign currency;
* In reality, it has split into a **dual-track system**.

Once this dual-track system takes hold, it acts like an undercurrent:
**On the surface, it’s the nation’s currency; beneath, the shadow dollar’s veins quietly circulate the lifeblood.**











### **Chapter Three: The Government’s Silence**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By 2025, Turkey’s **total external debt reached roughly \$500 billion**, of which **60% was short-term dollar-denominated debt**.
* Due to sanctions and declining international credit ratings, the Turkish Ministry of Finance faced severe liquidity gaps in the foreign exchange market.
* **USDT** became the most widely circulated and least volatile “quasi-dollar alternative” in the Turkish market.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

Late at night, the Ministry of Finance in Ankara is brightly lit.
The Finance Minister holds a debt report, pointing at the numbers:

> “We need to repay \$60 billion in short-term debt next quarter. Our foreign reserves are only \$2.8 billion—there’s no way to cover this in dollars.”

A deputy minister quietly suggests:

> “There’s enough USDT circulating in the black market and exchanges. If the Ministry collects it through shadow accounts, it could at least delay the crisis.”

The minister frowns but does not immediately reject the idea.
After a moment, he murmurs:

> “This stays inside this room. We don’t care what the public uses for payments. As long as the Ministry can fulfill obligations, even if it’s… USDT.”

---

A few days later, the CFO of a major Istanbul state-owned enterprise receives an “informal directive”:

* Continue paying employees in lira;
* But when settling energy and raw material payments with overseas suppliers, they may “try using the USDT channel.”

The CFO understands perfectly: this is tacit government approval.

---

#### **Public Perception**

Citizens begin to notice anomalies:

* Bank forex windows are increasingly closed;
* The black-market exchange rate diverges further from the official rate;
* Yet on Telegram and WhatsApp groups, USDT prices remain far more stable.

A taxi driver chuckles bitterly:

> “Lira is like sand, slips right through your fingers. But USDT? It’s like a rock, staying firmly in place.”

---

#### **Structural Analysis (Erkez’s Narrative Commentary)**

The government’s silence is not incompetence—it is necessity.

* **Short-term dollar debt** is an inescapable shackle;
* **Lira depreciation** makes repayment nearly impossible;
* **USDT** becomes the only “buffer tool” usable under the table.

This is a dangerous self-concealment:

* On the surface, the state still claims monetary sovereignty;
* In reality, the Ministry of Finance, like the public, begins relying on the “shadow dollar.”

> **When a nation’s Ministry of Finance starts using shadow currency, the country’s monetary sovereignty remains nothing more than a symbolic layer.**












### **Chapter Four: The Collapse of the Banking System**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By 2025, Turkish banks’ **non-performing loan ratio is projected to exceed 15%**, far above international warning levels.
* Multiple small and medium banks face runs, and queues for ATM withdrawals on Istanbul streets become routine.
* Credit rating agencies repeatedly downgrade expectations for Turkey’s financial system; some foreign banks withdraw from the market.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

Early morning, outside a bank near Taksim Square, Istanbul, the line snakes around the corner.
Depositors wear anxious expressions, clutching passbooks and IDs.
They aren’t there to withdraw lira—they want to “convert to USDT.”

Tellers repeat the same phrase with blank expressions:

> “Sir, our system is being upgraded. Please be patient.”

Regular customers understand that **“system upgrade” is code for cash shortage**.

---

#### **Bank’s Dilemma**

At a high-level meeting in a major commercial bank, the atmosphere is tense.

The deputy CEO slams the table:

> “If we delay any longer, branches will be overrun by depositors! They trust neither lira nor dollar accounts. The only thing they still trust is USDT.”

Another executive hesitates:

> “We can’t officially recognize cryptocurrency as legal payment…”

Before the words finish, the CEO cuts in coldly:

> “Recognition no longer matters. The market moves faster than we do.”

From that week, the bank **quietly launched an “e-wallet service”**:

* Deposits could be linked to “dollar-pegged assets”;
* Withdrawals added an option for “stablecoin transfers.”

The bank never explicitly mentioned “USDT,” but all customers understood.

---

#### **Public Reaction**

Business owners are thrilled:

* Loans are no longer in depreciating lira but in “stable” USDT;
* Exporters can now settle payments up and down the supply chain in USDT, reducing losses.

Ordinary citizens also tacitly understand:

* Bank lira accounts have long become “pocket money” wallets;
* Real wealth has been converted into “electronic dollars.”

Taxi driver Mohammed jokes:

> “The banks finally surrendered. They used to be the masters; now they’re just intermediaries.”

---

#### **Structural Analysis (Erkez’s Commentary)**

The collapse of the banking system isn’t a dramatic crash—it’s **being hollowed out by the market, piece by piece**.

* When non-performing loans exceed 15%, the credit chain breaks;
* When depositors vote with their feet, banks are forced to yield;
* When USDT becomes “semi-legal,” the central bank retains only hollow authority.

This is an invisible coup.

* The sovereign nation’s monetary system is gradually being overtaken by a “shadow currency”;
* Banks become puppets, compelled to accommodate the choices of depositors and businesses.

> **True failure is not financial collapse—it is the silent replacement of financial order.**












### **Chapter Five: The Ruins of the Lira**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By 2025, the **black market exchange rate of the Turkish lira had depreciated over 40% compared to the official rate**.
* The IMF issued a warning: Turkey is facing a “severe currency confidence crisis.”
* International investment bank reports show that more than half of domestic transactions—real estate, cars, even wedding gifts—**are settled in stablecoins or US dollars**.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

In Istanbul’s old town, a wedding is in full swing.
Amid drums and dancing, guests don’t hand over thick envelopes; instead, they pull out their phones and scan to transfer money.

“How much?” asks the groom’s cousin.
“100 USDT,” the groom’s father replies with a smile.

An elder at the table sighs:

> “In the past, we received gold bracelets or lira cash. Now? Weddings have become e-wallet parties.”

---

#### **The “Hidden Language” of Real Estate**

In a Besiktas real estate office, walls are lined with apartments for sale.
But the price lists show no lira—only cold numbers:

* **75,000 USDT**
* **120,000 USDT**
* **200,000 USDT**

The agent explains privately:

> “Listing in lira is pointless. Nobody trusts it. Dollars or USDT only. The lira price is just to appease the government.”

Buyers tacitly understand. Contracts still show lira amounts, but with an added clause:
**“Settlement method: converted according to USDT exchange rate.”**

---

#### **The Street Black Market**

At a café near Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, a group of young people trade quietly.
Whispers pass under the table:

* “Today the black market is 1 USD = 52 lira, 40% above the official rate.”
* “Forget it, just use USDT. Safe and fast.”

One phone, one wallet address, one transfer—
By the time the coffee cools, the money is already received.

---

#### **Erkez’s Commentary (Structural Analysis)**

This is no longer mere financial fluctuation; it is **the collapse of monetary sovereignty**.

* **Lira reduced to stage props**:
  Weddings, real estate, daily expenses—all bypass the official currency.
* **USDT becomes the real settlement tool**:
  The public has already voted with their actions; the central bank’s presence is irrelevant.
* **Black market rates become the “true price”**:
  The official rate is just propaganda; the real price is written in underground markets.

This is **the scene of ruins**:

* The lira didn’t die suddenly; it was buried by countless small acts of abandonment, stacked into a grave.

> **A nation’s currency is not destroyed—it is forgotten.**












### **Chapter Six: The Emergence of the Shadow Central Bank**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By 2025, the global **circulating supply of USDT exceeded \$150 billion**.
* Research reports show a **surge in holdings in the Middle East**, with Turkey ranking among the top five.
* SWIFT data reveals that **dollar settlements in Turkey’s cross-border payments sharply declined**, while on-chain stablecoin transfers skyrocketed.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

Inside Ankara’s Ministry of Finance building, the lights burn bright.
Ministers debate fiscal gaps and debt rollovers, yet continually avoid one uncomfortable truth:
**Turkey’s central bank has lost its monetary tools.**

— Interest rate adjustments? Ignored.
— Fiat settlement? The market abandoned it long ago.

At Istanbul’s commercial port, cross-border traders joke:

> “Before, we had to line up at banks to buy dollars, always fearing freezes.
> Now with USDT, clearing takes minutes. Faster than the central bank, safer than dollars.”

They even quip:

> “The real central bank is on-chain, not in Ankara.”

---

#### **Three Core Functions of the Shadow Central Bank**

1. **Unit of Account**

   * Turkish real estate, automobiles, and even cross-border contracts are all priced in USDT.
   * The lira has become a paper figure—a legal disguise in contracts.

2. **Payments and Settlement**

   * Exporters pay Middle Eastern suppliers directly in USDT.
   * Ships dock, cargo unloads, and on-chain transfers complete instantly.

3. **Store of Value and Trust**

   * Household wealth resides in mobile wallets, not bank accounts.
   * **The phone becomes a “branch,” and the USDT wallet serves as a “checking account.”**

---

#### **U.S. Tacit Approval**

Washington never publicly comments, yet silently nods.

* **On the surface**: The Treasury and IMF issue the usual warnings about “financial stability risks.”
* **Behind the scenes**: The U.S. does not hinder USDT’s global expansion, effectively “turning a blind eye.”

Erkez writes a cold line in his manuscript:

> “True hegemony is not direct intervention, but letting another country’s central bank become a mere facade.”

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

In Turkey’s reality:

* **The central bank continues daily announcements**, as if still manipulating exchange rates and adjusting the economy.
* **The market votes with its feet**:
  — Exchange rates dictated by the black market
  — Settlements executed via USDT
  — Savings held on-chain

It is an intensely ironic scene:

* The central bank building towers in Ankara,
* But the real central bank exists as a string of cold, impersonal smart contract addresses.

> **The shadow central bank has emerged—and its headquarters exist beyond any national border.**











### **Chapter Seven: The Empire’s Smile**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* Turkey has long been the strategic pivot of NATO’s southern flank, controlling the Bosporus Strait.
* The U.S. maintains troops and military interests in Syria and the Black Sea, making Turkey indispensable.
* By 2025, Turkey’s foreign exchange reserves are critically low, while **USDT usage in trade and savings exceeds 50%**.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

Inside Ankara’s government conference room, the air is heavy.
Officials sit pale-faced, yet no one dares to speak the words:

**“We have already lost our monetary sovereignty.”**

No foreign invasion, no cannon fire.
Turkey’s sovereignty quietly slips into mobile wallets and smart contracts.

---

#### **Washington’s Smile**

Across the ocean, a U.S. Treasury spokesperson smiles while answering reporters:

> “This is the market’s free choice.
> People will always opt for more stable, reliable currency tools.
> We respect the choice of the Turkish people.”

Casually phrased, yet it is the empire’s most exquisite irony.

It acknowledges no occupation, yet achieves takeover.
It claims no colony, yet establishes more efficient control.

**The empire’s smile is colder than guns.**

---

#### **Turkey’s Illusion**

Streets remain noisy; cafés still buzz with talk of football and stock markets.
The lira continues to bear the image of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, as if nothing has changed.

But the real wealth moves on-chain, circulating through digital wallets.

* Wedding gifts paid in USDT
* Real estate transactions in USDT
* Cross-border contracts settled instantly on-chain

The central bank building in Ankara becomes a symbolic monument.

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

Erkez writes in his manuscript:

> “A nation does not need cannons to perish.
> When its currency disappears from people’s pockets,
> its sovereignty has already been quietly inscribed in another ledger.”

Turkey has not been invaded, yet under the empire’s smile—it has **fallen economically.**












### **Chapter Eight: The Phantom of Resistance**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* In 2025, Turkish nationalist parties called to “defend the lira,” attempting to legislate bans on public cryptocurrency use.
* In reality, Turkey’s central bank had already prohibited crypto payments in 2021, but enforcement was limited; black market and OTC trading remained active.
* By 2025, **USDT usage in Middle Eastern cross-border trade had surpassed cash USD**.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

In Ankara’s parliamentary hall, microphones echoed with angry slogans.
Nationalist lawmakers slammed tables, shouting:

> “This is a new colonialism!
> We must ban cryptocurrency!
> The lira is our dignity!”

For a moment, the applause thundered, as if it could shatter the chains of finance.

---

#### **Public Apathy**

Yet, the streets remained indifferent.
Wedding gifts were already in USDT,
imported medicines could only be paid in USDT,
and banks had quietly opened USDT accounts.

**The passion of nationalism met the ledger of households.**

Ordinary people understood: emotions can roar, but wallets must stay calm.

---

#### **Islamist Attempts**

On a mosque pulpit, an imam declared passionately:

> “This is a Western conspiracy!
> We must return to gold and silver coins, to the true Islamic monetary order!”

But the youth just shook their heads.
With smartphones in hand, transfers took only three seconds.
The romance of gold and silver offered no help in real life.

---

#### **The Phantom of Resistance**

Legislative notices plastered the streets: “Cryptocurrency payments prohibited.”
Yet underground trading continued, and foreign trade still relied on on-chain settlement.

Turkey’s resistance had become a shadow.
Surface noise, substance silence.
Like a person raising arms to resist a flood, only to realize the water had already filled their lungs.

---

#### **Narrative Closure**

Erkez wrote in his manuscript:

> “The phantom of resistance is merely the final ritual.
> When the true function of currency has already been transferred,
> no decree, no slogan, is more than a footnote in history.”












### **Chapter Nine: The Conspiracy of Power**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* Turkey controls the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, key strategic points linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.
* In 2025, Europe faced an unresolved energy crisis; internal cracks within the euro deepened, and Eastern European countries faced high fiscal deficits.
* The U.S. held multinational joint exercises in the Black Sea and Mediterranean, nominally to “protect freedom of trade routes.”

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

Ankara, the underground conference room of the Presidential Palace.

The air was thick with the mixed scent of coffee and cigarette smoke.
The President, Finance Minister, military generals, and the central bank governor were all present.

The Finance Minister spread out his report, voice heavy:

> “External debts are maturing, we don’t have enough dollars,
> we can only rely on USDT from the market to make ends meet.”

A military general slammed the table:

> “If the U.S. threatens us, we’ll block the straits!
> The key to the Black Sea is in our hands, who dares challenge us?”

Silence filled the room.
Everyone knew this was merely anger speaking, not reality.

---

#### **Constraints of Reality**

The Chief of Staff responded coldly:

> “The U.S. Navy is exercising simultaneously in the Black Sea and Mediterranean.
> With just a claim to ‘protect trade freedom,’
> they could sail warships to Istanbul’s doorstep.
> The straits aren’t a bargaining chip—they’re a powder keg.”

The President exhaled slowly, eyes weary:

> “We aren’t negotiating with the U.S.,
> we’re negotiating with reality.”

---

#### **Europe’s Cold Gaze**

At the same time, in a conference room in Brussels, EU officials sat stiffly.
Eastern European member states’ fiscal deficits were like cracks, the largest vulnerability in the euro.
They knew: if USDT could breach Turkey, it could breach Eastern Europe as well.

But Europe lacked the courage to confront the U.S.
Germany worried about energy, France about industry, Italy about debt.
All nations shivered quietly, issuing regulations only to “delay” USDT’s encroachment legally.

---

#### **The Conclusion of Conspiracy**

The Ankara meeting ultimately concluded not with resistance, but compromise:
**“Use in silence, deny publicly.”**

The Finance Ministry quietly increased USDT reserves,
the military continued shouting nationalist slogans,
and the central bank’s statements remained:

> “The Turkish lira is the only legal currency.”

This was a conspiracy of power—
resistance on the surface, submission in secret.

---

#### **Narrative Closure**

Erkez wrote in his manuscript:

> “When a nation faces monetary colonization, the choice is not justice or betrayal,
> but public anger and private collusion.
> Resistance is only posture; cooperation is order.”













### **Chapter Ten: The Fractures of Europe**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* In 2025, several Eastern European countries relied on exports with over 35% settled in U.S. dollars.
* The Turkish lira depreciated against USDT by more than 50%, increasing European banks’ exposure to Turkey.
* In Kazakhstan, the share of USDT and RMB-backed stablecoins in foreign reserves rose rapidly.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

Brussels, EU headquarters.

The conference room lights were harsh as officials closely monitored Turkey’s currency movements on screen.

> “Turkey is effectively defunct; USDT has taken over their sovereign currency.”
> The representative from the Bank of France frowned.

A German official said coldly:

> “We must prevent the euro system from being shocked. Eastern European countries are the weak link.”

Delegates from Eastern European states lowered their heads, calculating:

> “Legal measures, regulatory restrictions, settlement controls… all efforts may only serve as buffers.”

Meanwhile, in Central Asia, Astana, Kazakhstan.

The president addressed a meeting:

> “We will allow legal exchanges between USDT and RMB-backed stablecoins.
> By positioning ourselves between the two major stablecoin systems, we become a buffer zone.
> Any attempt by either side to fully control our economy must contend with the other.”

The Minister of Economy added:

> “This preserves our innovation space while preventing lock-in by a single major power.”

A diplomat quietly reminded:

> “Being between China, the U.S., and Russia entails both strategic risk and opportunity.
> Every step must be cautious, publicly acknowledged yet privately managed.”

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

* Eastern European nations attempt self-preservation, yet structural fractures are already forming.
* Turkey’s sovereignty has not been directly militarily invaded, but it has collapsed economically.
* Kazakhstan strategically integrates two stablecoins, becoming a “buffer zone” in the great-power game.
* The presence of USDT and RMB-backed stablecoins reshapes the global financial competition: innovation and economic freedom are now institutionally distributed.

---

#### **Inner Narration**

Erkez wrote:

> “When the shadow of power crosses borders, the boundaries of law and institutions are stretched.
> The nations truly capable of self-protection are not those with the strongest armies, but those with the most flexible structures.
> Turkey has lost its sovereignty; Eastern Europe and Central Asia are learning to survive within the fractures.”












### **Chapter Eleven: On the Eve of the Stablecoin War**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By the end of 2025, global USDT circulation surpassed \$200 billion, with usage in the Middle East and Eastern Europe increasing by over 60%.
* China’s RMB-backed stablecoin (DCEP/CBDC) had over 500 exchange points in pilot cities across Asia and Africa.
* IMF reports warned that the rapid spread of stablecoins could render traditional monetary policy ineffective.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

New York, Wall Street Exchange.

Quant trading teams watched USDT flows against USD and RMB on their screens.

> “Beyond Turkey, Eastern Europe and Central Asia are all seeking buffer zones.”
> The trading supervisor frowned: “Any major power trying to suppress USDT directly could trigger a chain reaction.”

Meanwhile, digital currency research teams in Beijing and Hong Kong quietly deployed RMB stablecoin exchange systems.

> “USDT’s spread reveals an omniscient model of economic control,”
> the project lead recorded calmly, “We must act quickly, or our innovation capacity will be locked.”

Washington, a joint Treasury and Defense Department meeting.

> “USDT has effectively formed a shadow central bank in Turkey,”
> a senior advisor reported, “No blockade or sanction can directly control civilian usage.”
> “So we only need to observe, fine-tune, and guide market flows,”
> a defense official added, “Once the stablecoin war begins, nations will delineate spheres of influence; military intervention is not the first choice.”

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

* Major global economies began covertly positioning around USDT and RMB stablecoins, accelerating financial competition.
* Each country sought its own “buffer zone” to maintain innovation capacity and economic autonomy.
* The stablecoin war had not officially broken out, but tensions were rising on the eve: tacit approval by major powers, regional defenses, and peripheral countries protecting themselves.

---

#### **Inner Narration in the Novel**

Erkez wrote:

> “When stablecoins become tools of new power, the boundaries of traditional monetary policy and national sovereignty are redefined.
> War is no longer bullets and tanks, but flowing digital assets and information control.
> Whoever understands this trend will survive the next round of order.”











### **Chapter Twelve: Global Buffer Zones**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* Global USDT circulation surged, while RMB-backed stablecoin exchange institutions spread across Asia, Africa, and South America.
* Russia’s grain exports rely on Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Central Asia, while energy exports depend heavily on Europe and India.
* Some populations in North America and the Arctic favored annexation by the U.S. through referendums to mitigate financial risk.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

**Division of Influence Among the U.S., China, and Russia**

* **U.S. sphere**: North America, the First Island Chain, parts of South America’s coastal nations; USDT serves as the de facto currency, allowing the U.S. to control offshore economic sovereignty.
* **China’s sphere**: Southeast Asia, Africa, parts of South America; RMB stablecoins become the tool for liquidity and settlement, establishing China’s financial buffer zones.
* **Russia’s sphere**: Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and countries dependent on Russian energy and grain exports; although its stablecoin deployment started late, reliance on resources provides a strategic counterbalance to U.S. and China.

---

#### **Plot**

Moscow, a conference room. Russia’s economic minister analyzed calmly:

> “We missed USDT’s starting point, but food and energy are our leverage. India, Southeast Asia, and Africa have become our arenas of influence.”

Washington, Treasury and Defense joint briefing:

> “Europe and Central Asia’s stablecoin networks show direct competition between the U.S. and China. European countries fear financial collapse and are racing to build defenses, but gaps remain.”

Mexico City, the finance minister reports to the cabinet:

> “We cannot resist USDT. Joining the U.S. system is choosing survival over resistance.”

Tokyo, Taipei, Manila: financial institutions in the First Island Chain have fully integrated USDT systems:

> “Offshore dollar tokens control payments and settlements. National monetary sovereignty is merely symbolic.”

Parts of Canada and Greenland held quasi-referendums:

> “Joining the U.S. system avoids financial collapse.”

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

* The global stablecoin battlefield has produced buffer zones: each continent relies on a different stablecoin system for self-preservation.
* Resources, population, and geopolitics have become the new instruments of competition: grain, energy, ports, and financial systems intertwine.
* National monetary sovereignty grows increasingly fragile against offshore digital currencies, creating a stark disconnect between visible politics and core power.

---

#### **Inner Narration in the Novel**

Erkez wrote:

> “The structure of global buffer zones completely redefines traditional state divisions and financial sovereignty.
> Major powers manipulate peripheral economies through stablecoins, while edge nations adopt survival strategies.
> This is a war without gunpowder: every digital transaction is a bullet, every exchange rate adjustment a strategic deployment.”











### **Chapter Thirteen: The Dissolution of Finance and Sovereignty**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By 2025, the GDP of the British Empire and Commonwealth countries shows industrial output dropping to less than 4% of the global total, with the vast majority of foreign trade dependent on the U.S. market.
* Attempts to peg the pound to the dollar or USDT failed; offshore market acceptance was minimal.
* Financial instruments endorsed by the British royal family wielded almost no influence in North American, Asian, or Middle Eastern markets.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

London, a conference room in the Financial District. The Governor of the Bank of England spoke quietly:

> “We tried to establish a Greater British economic system by pegging the pound to stablecoins, but industrial hollowing has left our currency incapable of supporting an independent economy.”

Representatives from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand argued:

> “Even with royal backing, our dependence on the U.S. economy is undeniable. Our trade, finance, and investments have almost completely detached from London’s center.”

On the streets of London, ordinary investors complained:

> “Pound-backed stablecoins? They’re disconnected from our daily lives. We’re all using USDT or RMB stablecoins.”

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

* The façade of the financial system is completely misaligned with the reality of sovereignty: the monarchy and national symbols remain, but offshore markets and everyday transactions are dominated by foreign stablecoins.
* Major powers manipulate peripheral economies via stablecoins and digital currencies, while traditional symbols of sovereignty—like the monarchy, flags, and currency denominations—have lost practical authority.
* Global capitalism has entered a stage of state capitalism: money is no longer just a medium of exchange but a strategic instrument.

---

#### **Inner Narration in the Novel**

Erkez wrote:

> “The failure of pound-pegged stablecoins reveals the fragility of finance and sovereignty.
> National symbols and institutions are hollow before digital currencies.
> Capital flows, exchange rate signals, and stablecoin settlements now determine a country’s fate far more than any monarchy or parliament ever could.”












### **Chapter Fourteen: The Global Landscape of State Capitalism**

#### **Novel Data Points**

* By the end of 2026, the total circulating supply of global stablecoins surpassed \$600 billion (for a country like Turkey, an active circulating currency volume of only \$50 billion would suffice), with USDT accounting for 45%, China’s RMB-backed stablecoins 25%, and Russia’s stablecoins 10%.
* Some countries in Central Asia, South Asia, and Africa adopted dual-currency access to form “buffer zones,” preventing any single major power from fully controlling their economies.
* Certain Eastern European and South American countries, due to financial and energy dependencies, were gradually forced to integrate into multi-country stablecoin systems.

---

#### **Novel Narrative**

In a conference room along the Black Sea, representatives from Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine spoke quietly:

> “We must maintain control over our domestic markets while preventing any single stablecoin from dominating our economy, or our national sovereignty will become symbolic at best.”

Financial officials from India, Brazil, and South Africa joined online:

> “We’ve launched a dual-currency exchange system, circulating the RMB-backed stablecoin alongside USDT.
> Even if the U.S. heavily purchases Treasuries, our markets retain autonomous space.”

In a North American meeting room, a U.S. military observer remarked casually:

> “Integrating the First Island Chain fully into USDT is a strategic success, but the peripheral buffer zones still require attention.
> We tolerate their existence to stabilize the global order, not to let them seize initiative.”

---

#### **Narrative Focus**

* Countries create strategic buffers through multi-currency systems and autonomous settlement institutions, preventing any single major power from “omniscient domination.”
* State capitalism is gradually taking shape: the right to issue currency, fiscal autonomy, and policy independence no longer solely depend on traditional sovereignty, but on access to stablecoin systems and strategic negotiation.
* Small and medium countries must balance between USDT, RMB-backed, and Russian stablecoins, or risk losing economic initiative.

## **Volume Three: Reality’s Backlash (The Fall of Korea)**

### **Chapter One: The Omen**

The night of March 2026 was colder than usual. Winter still lingered in Washington, and the streetlights stretched long, lonely shadows. Erkez sat at his desk, the only glow in the room coming from his laptop screen—a cold, white light. Several pages were open at once: the intraday curve of the won against the dollar, USDT order books from Seoul’s major exchanges, and a manuscript he had read countless times—the words still carried the fatigue and anxiety of when he first wrote them.

He laid the data out before him: South Korea’s foreign reserve debt structure was abnormal, with short-term external debt disproportionately high; retail investors had entered the “crypto sphere” in record numbers; and the asymmetry in the U.S.-Korea alliance treaty was no longer a secret.

But the live chart in the top corner of his screen showed no hesitation. USDT volumes in Seoul looked as though a switch had been flipped—from gentle fluctuations to a sudden vertical surge. Offshore won-dollar quotes were pressing against the threshold he had once described in his novel. It was a strange sense of synchronization—the rhythm of his prose and the heartbeat of the market overlapped, like two clocks striking the same hour.

Roya sat beside him, the laptop’s glow reflected across her face. She stared at the curve, her knuckles whitening.

> “This is coincidence, isn’t it? You know how it is—you write things too logically, people might suspect it, but reality is random. It doesn’t follow your tempo.”

Erkez remained silent for a long time, his hand motionless on the mouse. He had no desire to reveal the fear behind his writing, but the facts struck like cold water, impossible to ignore. When he finally spoke, his voice was unusually calm, almost subdued:

> “Turkey in the novel was just a rehearsal, Roya. The data, public adoption, regulatory blind spots—we could all predict those. What’s different now is that it’s happening for real. Korea’s market is more sophisticated, more leveraged, with deeper retail participation. A market with high leverage, momentum trading, and an outsized retail share—once trust shifts to the shadow dollar, the collapse will only come faster.”

Roya looked up, her eyes filled with both fear and defiance.

> “Are you saying this out loud? That someone might be using our novel as a blueprint?”

Erkez turned from the screen to her, his gaze stripped of irony, nothing but the calm after long calculation:

> “I’ll state two facts. First, anyone who understands the path we laid out could use it—whether for profit or as an experiment. Second, such use doesn’t require military force or public acknowledgment. The market itself will do the work. The volume of currency in daily circulation isn’t that high. Even for a country the size of Turkey, \$50 billion is enough. To seize control of the market, three to five times that capital is sufficient. Turkey was a rehearsal in the novel, because its demographics and economic fragilities were ideal for testing. Korea is the real target, because its industry, payment infrastructure, and external dependencies make the effect magnified.”

Outside, another midnight news alert appeared: sell orders were flooding Seoul’s crypto exchanges, and offshore USDT quotes were climbing relentlessly. Erkez’s hand trembled slightly. He flipped to the last page of his manuscript, dragging it back to the very front. There, in his own words, lay a warning he had once written: *Shadows can grow in the night, and what shadows devour are always the cities that believe themselves safe in daylight.*

Roya drew in a deep breath, her voice nearly inaudible:

> “So what do we do? Was your writing a warning… or a sentence?”

Erkez didn’t answer immediately. He placed his fingers on the keyboard, typed a few words, then erased them. On the screen, a new blank line blinked like the pulse of the night—

*“The omen is no longer an omen. It has become a melody. The question now is: who will dance to it?”*

Outside, the wind blew past, carrying with it the first gust of the coming storm.












Roya’s brow furrowed, and at last she couldn’t bear the silence any longer.

> “But I don’t understand,” she said quietly, her voice tinged with impatience. “Argentina, Venezuela—even parts of Brazil—long ago abandoned their own currencies under hyperinflation, switching to dollar pricing. They embraced USDT even earlier than Turkey or Korea. If that’s the case, why doesn’t the U.S. simply take full control of the South American market? The people there are already used to the dollar—it should be seamless, shouldn’t it?”

Erkez leaned back in his chair, as if he had been waiting for this question. When he spoke, his voice was steady, edged with a cool sharpness:

> “Roya, you must remember—pushing stablecoins isn’t about small-scale harvesting. The ultimate purpose is to **underwrite America’s medium- to long-term debt issuance**. This isn’t a simple game of currency substitution. It’s a cycle: the spread of dollar tokens has to be tied to demand for U.S. treasuries in order to form a closed loop of dollar recycling. Which means it requires a nation that can provide a lasting ‘anchor’—either a **strong industrial exporter** or a **strong resource exporter**.”

He paused, his fingers tapping lightly on the desk like a muted metronome.

> “South American nations can be harvested, yes. But their productive capacity isn’t sufficient to backstop U.S. debt. You could make every Argentine, every Venezuelan transact in USDT—but what can they export in return? Agricultural goods, cheap raw materials? Too small in scale to shoulder the weight of America’s debt expansion.”

Roya parted her lips, but he raised a hand to stop her.

> “Besides, America’s so-called industrial ‘reshoring’ is built on **automation technology**. The problem is—automation is nowhere near mature enough to sustain full-scale production repatriation. The Rust Belt revival was an illusion from the start. They simply don’t have that depth of technical reserves. Even if reshoring were pursued, in the end it would depend on **skilled immigration** to fill the gaps.”

A faint, cutting smile touched his lips.

> “As for undocumented migrants? Their labor profile is useless for high-automation industries. Those roles aren’t about picking apples or washing dishes—they demand highly trained engineers and data workers. Undocumented labor can’t do that.”

Roya lowered her eyes, murmuring:

> “So… instead of clinging to the fantasy of reviving the Rust Belt, it makes more sense to control production nations directly—draw them into the dollar system through USDT?”

Erkez’s gaze sharpened instantly.

> “Exactly. Better to let others build the dream for you than waste strength building it at home. Turkey is the rehearsal. Korea is the breakthrough. And South America—” he paused, his tone hard as steel, “South America is merely a **vassal after the harvest**. It can bleed, but it cannot anchor.”

The room fell silent. Only the laptop screen remained alive, flashing with real-time exchange rates. The curve of USDT against the won was widening into a gap, like a wound silently tearing open.











### **Chapter Two: Algorithmic Blackout**

The night was heavy, and the air in Washington carried the chill of early spring. In the study, the cold light of the computer screen reflected on Erkez’s face.

* **After April 2026**, the situation quietly shifted. *Empire Currency*, which had briefly surged to bestseller lists, vanished entirely from Google’s recommendation pages; Amazon’s algorithms went further, blocking keywords outright. Even if readers searched the book by name, they would only find an inconspicuous result buried deep on the tenth page. Library systems synced their data to the cloud, and publishers’ databases quietly connected to “censorship interfaces,” turning borrowing records into a form of surveillance.

Sales plummeted, as if someone had flipped a switch in the background.

When Roya opened her email, her fingers trembled—an anonymous message stood out starkly:

> “Stop. You’ve crossed the line. Continue at your own risk.”

Cold and brief, yet carrying an unmistakable threat.

She stormed into the study, slamming the email onto Erkez’s desk, her voice a mix of fury and fear: “Look! This is the price! Writing this book isn’t enlightenment—it’s painting a target on our backs!”

Erkez merely stared at the screen, his gaze deep, a faint, cold smile playing on his lips. Just an hour earlier, he had received an encrypted call from a former colleague. In a suppressed, low voice, the person warned:

> “Erkez, this book has already been classified as a **potential national security threat**. The framework you studied… may already have been repurposed. Be careful.”

The air thickened with tension.

Roya’s voice trembled with anger: “If they’re really using your research, aren’t we helping them? What you left behind isn’t evidence—it’s **ammunition**!”

Erkez closed his laptop, his eyes still calm:

> “No, Roya. The real danger isn’t what we wrote—it’s **if we leave nothing at all**. History needs witnesses. Even if they block and censor it, the system will read and understand this book first. Humans may fail to grasp it, but machines will not.”

He sighed lightly, his tone measured and resolute:

> “This isn’t provocation. It’s archiving. We must leave proof—even if the cost is becoming the target.”

Roya stared at him, eyes full of conflict: a mix of awe at Erkez’s calm, and deep fear of the unavoidable shadow of censorship.

—The shadow of publication had finally extended its claws.










Roya paced uneasily around the study, arms wrapped tightly around herself, as if trying to ward off an invisible chill.

“Erkez,” she said, her voice tense, “have you thought—if they take your framework and apply it directly to South Korea, Turkey, or even Europe, won’t we be seen as **knowing accomplices**? One charge of ‘leaking secrets’ could erase us forever.”

Erkez watched her quietly, as if he had anticipated this moment. He placed a hand on the desk and spoke slowly:

> “The real danger isn’t that they’ll catch us—it’s that they **won’t catch us**. Doesn’t that seem strange? If this book really crosses a forbidden line, why only algorithmic blackouts, instead of outright takedown, instead of prosecution?”

Roya frowned, her tone demanding: “Then what do you think?”

Erkez exhaled slowly, his voice low and deliberate:

> “Because the plan is already underway. The path has been repurposed, execution is already in motion. They don’t need the public to debate it, or scholars to study it—they just need to freeze us in place, keep us silent.”

He paused, his gaze sharp as a blade:

> “So, their goal isn’t to destroy this book—it’s to **freeze it cold**. Let it exist, but buried by algorithms. Let it become evidence, yet unreadable. We just stay quiet, wait for the dust of the currency war to settle, and we’ll be forgotten. Speak one word too many, and it’s the same as declaring that you see the whole board.”

The study fell silent, the only sound the ticking of the old wall clock.

Roya’s breathing quickened, as if cornered: “So… we just wait to die?”

Erkez shook his head, his voice stern:

> “No, Roya. This isn’t waiting to die—it’s waiting. **Silence, in itself, is a form of protection.**”

In that moment, she finally understood—they were already in a game of chess, and the only piece they could still move was “silence.”









**The Breach in Korea**

May 2026, Seoul.
On the stock exchange screens in the early morning hours, red numbers cascaded like a breached dam.

In Korea’s foreign exchange market, the won broke through **₩1,700 per USD** overnight.

* The Ministry of Finance held an emergency meeting, announcing the use of foreign reserves to stabilize the market—but it soon became clear that one-third of the reserves were short-term external debt, completely untouchable.
* Interbank markets fell into panic, and business owners quietly turned to **USDT and BTC** for settlements.
* On Korean social media, “USDT hedge” became a trending topic; young people began paying directly with USDT at convenience stores and cafés.

---

In the study, Roya threw a stack of printed news onto the desk, her gaze sharp.

> “Erkez, look! This is exactly like the Turkish path you wrote in your novel: official statements, market failure, people saving themselves. Only this time, it’s happening in Korea.”

Erkez flipped through the pages quietly, his fingers tracing the data curves, and murmured:

> “This isn’t coincidence—it’s a template. The Turkey in the novel was a rehearsal; Korea is the real performance. The US military doesn’t need to invade, they just watch the market collapse on its own.”

Roya’s voice trembled, yet carried anger:

> “But this is a real country! Millions of people are being pushed into an abyss! They don’t even know how step by step their monetary sovereignty was stripped away!”

Erkez lifted his head, eyes cold and weary:

> “This is the essence of financial war—no smoke, yet colder than cannon fire. Have you noticed? The algorithms are still blocking us. Whatever we say, it won’t get out.”

Roya gripped his hand tightly, whispering:

> “So we just stand by and watch?”

Erkez shook his head, voice low:

> “All we can do is leave the evidence. Let the people of the future know that this wasn’t a natural disaster—it was designed.”

The clock on the wall struck midnight with a solemn “dong—,” as if mourning Korea’s breach.










**Emergency Meeting**

June 2026, Blue House, Seoul.
At 2 a.m., the South Korean president summoned senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the central bank, the intelligence agency, and the military into an underground conference room. The air was thick with the acrid scent of coffee and the ink of printed papers.

**Core Agenda:** Whether to freeze the circulation of USDT in Korea.

---

The finance minister spoke rapidly, as if reading battlefield dispatches:

> “The won has already fallen below 1,800, and the sell-off in the foreign exchange market hasn’t stopped. If we don’t freeze USDT transactions immediately, our monetary sovereignty will be completely lost!”

The central bank governor shook his head, voice hoarse:

> “Freeze it? With what? Forty percent of retail payments have already shifted to USDT. Young people use it for coffee, concert tickets; companies use it for import-export settlements. If you ban it, the market will immediately move underground, and trust will collapse entirely.”

The military representative slammed the table heavily:

> “Then we deploy the military and police! Shut down exchanges and payment channels entirely! Cut international network nodes if necessary!”

Before anyone could react, the intelligence chief interjected coldly:

> “You dare? The U.S. military is stationed in Korea. Their exercises are an open warning. If we try to shut down the network, the U.S. will impose martial law under the pretext of ‘protecting trade freedom.’ Do you think they care about international law? Do you think this is a game?”

The room fell into deadly silence.

The president pinched his forehead, voice low:

> “So… we don’t even have a choice?”

The finance minister sighed:

> “Mr. President, it’s not that there’s no choice, only that the choices are bad. Freeze it, and the market collapses; don’t freeze it, and monetary sovereignty disappears.”

---

Amid the stalemate, the intelligence agency submitted a classified briefing:
**IMF statement—‘Support for market freedom,’ calling stablecoins a ‘natural evolution of financial innovation.’**

The words were like an ice blade, piercing straight into the heart of the room.

The president stared at the document, silent for a long moment. Finally, he forced a bitter smile:

> “So, the IMF has already sided with the U.S. We don’t even have the right to ask for help.”

---

After the meeting, Erkez received an anonymously forwarded copy of the minutes. He told Roya:

> “This is the logic of financial colonization—you haven’t been invaded, yet you realize your country no longer belongs to you.”








**Silent Collapse**

The nights in Seoul were brightly lit, and the streets of Gangnam remained crowded. Refrigerators in convenience stores hummed, young people paid with their phones, and in the fleeting moment the QR code flashed, no one cared what currency they were using.

**The “₩” symbol still appeared on receipts, but it was merely a shell.**
Back-end settlements had long shifted to USDT.

At weddings, red envelopes no longer contained thick stacks of won bills, but screenshots of transfers.
The older generation awkwardly learned to download wallet apps, just to complete this gesture of propriety.

In corporate meeting rooms, finance directors calmly announced:

> “Starting next month, all cross-border procurement will be settled in USDT to avoid exchange rate risks.”

Employees nodded, no one raised objections.

Everything seemed **natural, convenient, and stable.**

---

Evening news on television reported:

> “The South Korean economy maintains stable recovery, with international investors showing continued confidence in the market.”

The visuals showed bustling streets and smiling citizens.

No one noticed that the data cited in the subtitles came directly from the IMF’s “Latest Free Market Report.”

---

Late at night, in an office building north of the Han River, a few central bank staff worked overtime organizing files.
One internal document was quietly bound:
*“Report on the Freezing of the Won’s International Settlement Functions.”*

No news coverage, no parliamentary debate, no public protest.
The file would quietly be transferred to the archives, locked in an iron cabinet that no one ever opened.

---

**The citizens noticed nothing.**
They still took selfies in cafés, scrolled through short videos on the subway, chased discounts on e-commerce platforms.

All they saw was convenience and stability,
unaware that—

**Monetary sovereignty was dead, and the nation was silently perishing.**











**The Age of Predators**

Outside, the night was thick, and the wind rustled the scattered papers on the desk.

Roya stared quietly at the news on the screen, her fingers clenching involuntarily, her voice low:

> “Erkez… I’m starting to understand more clearly. Cryptocurrency, this so-called decentralized technology… after following the scenarios in your book, it’s hard not to suspect it was designed by the U.S.”

She lifted her eyes, gaze firm:

> “Its purpose isn’t freedom, isn’t financial innovation—it’s an omniscient ledger.
> As long as all transactions are on-chain, the U.S. can see the economic movements of any country, any individual, in real time. **Omniscience**—this is scarier than any spy satellite.”

She paused, then a realization struck her, and her tone suddenly sharpened:

> “But the threat of omniscience drains a nation’s vitality. Once everything can be seen, there’s no buffer, no room to pretend ignorance.
> It’s like Israel, often questioned why they don’t act before danger strikes. In fact, they know—but must pretend not to, because only by feigning ignorance can the state keep functioning.
> The U.S. implementing this omniscient ledger… it takes away every country’s right to ‘pretend not to know.’”

The study fell into a brief silence.

Erkez leaned back in his chair, a faint, cold smile playing on his lips.

> “You’re asking the right question. But the issue isn’t ‘why design it,’ it’s ‘why activate it now.’”

Roya’s breath caught. She stared at him, her voice nearly trembling:

> “Why? Because of the president? Or because internal struggles are finally over?”

Erkez shook his head, his gaze deep, as if looking toward a horizon beyond Earth:

> “Not the president… it’s because humanity is entering the **space civilization era.**”

He paused, his tone cutting:

> “This starry expanse cannot allow more than two hundred countries and regions to have equal access to space.
> The essence of the currency war is **the U.S., China, and Russia settling scores with two hundred countries and regions—a reckoning on the hunting grounds.**
> Space resources cannot be evenly divided, but they won’t be monopolized by the U.S. either.
> This is the dawn of the age of predation—every nation is either a hunter or the hunted.”

Roya held her breath, a chill rising in her chest. She suddenly realized that Erkez’s novel had never been mere literary creation—it was a cold, calculated **hunting manual.**











**Humans in the Hunt**

Roya leaned against the edge of the desk, her fingers gripping the laptop so tightly that her knuckles whitened. Thoughts surged through her mind like a rising tide:

> “Space civilization… predation… are we all the prey?” she murmured, her voice lonely in the empty study.

Suddenly, she realized that cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, USDT… all of this was not merely a financial tool, but a means of **omniscient control**.
The economic behaviors of nations, corporations, and individuals were almost entirely exposed to algorithms and on-chain ledgers. Every transaction, every settlement, felt like it had been embedded into an invisible hunting net.

> “Could it be… that we were never truly free?” Her eyes glistened, her voice trembling with a fear she could not suppress.

Erkez looked at her, his gaze gentle yet carrying a rational, unwavering certainty:

> “Freedom exists only within sovereignty. Your life, your choices—within U.S. borders, the rules allow you to take risks, to innovate—you have project-like freedom.
> But once you step beyond the bounds of sovereignty, your freedom must follow the most stable order of the rules. Otherwise, you become the hunted.”

Roya bit her lip, whispering a question:

> “Then… are we still human? Or… are we merely part of the prey?”

Erkez fell silent for a moment, then spoke softly:

> “We are observers, and we are participants. Only by understanding the rules can we choose how to act. Just like Turkey in the novel, and Korea in reality—every manipulated country is part of the hunting grounds.
> You can choose to hide, or you can stand at the edge of the rules, observe, analyze, and wait for opportunity.”

Roya nodded slowly, a complex mix of emotions rising within her—fear, helplessness, and a strange thrill. She knew she could no longer withdraw; the hunting grounds were unfolding. She had to learn to survive within them, while understanding the logic behind the hunt.

Outside, night shrouded the world. Under the light, the shadows of the two of them stretched and intertwined across the walls of the study.










### **Chapter 3: The Blue House Storm**

* **Time**: August 2026
* **Location**: Seoul, Crisis Response Chamber, Blue House

The trading volume of the Korean won against both the U.S. dollar and USDT had surged abnormally, flooding the financial system with red alerts. The central bank rushed to convene an emergency meeting, attempting to freeze crypto exchange records—but the effort proved futile. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ledger meant no single institution could ever gain full control.

Roya, flipping through the simulation data provided by Erkez, asked softly:

> “If even the central bank can’t intervene… what does that mean?”

Erkez answered calmly:

> “It means the traditional sovereignty of money has begun to collapse. Korea is nothing more than a reenactment of the Turkish model—but on a larger scale, and at a faster pace.”

Inside the chamber, the Minister of Economy and financial regulators argued heatedly: Should they shut down exchanges? Should they appeal to the international community? One official suggested blockading ports and straits to pressure the U.S., but was immediately reminded that U.S. military exercises in the Western Pacific meant any such move could be interpreted as a threat to trade freedom—risking direct military confrontation.

Roya sighed under her breath:

> “So the entire system… has already slipped beyond national control.”

Erkez nodded:

> “Exactly. USDT is not just currency—it is a weapon of information warfare: omniscient in its ledger, free in its flow, untamperable. Now, any nation that tries to feign ignorance only exposes its position on the hunting ground.”

On his laptop, he marked trading curves, account flows, and cross-border fund trajectories. His gaze remained steady, though he knew in his heart: Korea’s monetary crisis was merely the prelude to a global currency war.

On the screen, USDT trading volumes continued to soar. The jagged curves pulsed like a heartbeat, reminding everyone—none of this was an accident.











* South Korea was shaken by street protests as the “crypto bankruptcy wave” swept through society. People waved placards, shouting their anger at the government and exchanges, demanding protection for their savings and investments.

* The government convened an emergency meeting at the Blue House to discuss intervention measures. Yet every attempt to freeze or restrict crypto transactions was thwarted by reality—the blockchain ledger was decentralized, transactions globalized, and no single nation could exert full control.

* Beside them, Erkez was logging shifts in the data. He remarked coolly:

  > “What the public sees is only the surface—turmoil, panic, protests. But the real power doesn’t lie in the streets; it lies in the movement of capital and information networks.”

* Roya, tense, asked:

  > “Then what can we do? Just watch as the nation gets taken over?”

* After a pause, Erkez replied slowly:

  > “What we can do is wait. Freezing, marginalization, algorithmic restrictions—all the signs show the plan is already in motion. Stay silent, observe, record the data. The currency war itself will give us the answer in the end.”

* The street demonstrations spread like a tide, yet the deeper tremors in the financial markets moved in silence. Ordinary citizens noticed only the chaos before their eyes, never grasping the global strategy unfolding behind it.










* The Blue House declared a state of emergency. The South Korean president attempted to freeze USDT circulation, but with crypto networks decentralized and exchanges scattered worldwide, administrative orders alone could not effectively stop the flow of funds.

* The Bank of Korea and the Ministry of Finance convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures: restricting exchange withdrawals, freezing large USDT accounts, tightening KYC checks. Yet each proposal was weakened by operational complexity and technical loopholes.

* Erkez, quietly recording market data, analyzed with calm precision:

  > “Every attempt at a freeze looks like political action on the surface, but in truth it’s only to give the public an illusion—that the state is still in control. Real capital flows and market signals left government hands long ago.”

* Roya furrowed her brow and asked softly:

  > “Then what about ordinary people? They’re completely in the dark.”

* Erkez sighed:

  > “Exactly. Street protests, media headlines, political decrees—they’re all surface. The real battlefield lies in ledgers, algorithms, and cross-border flows. Ordinary people see only the chaos, never the core.”

* The cries of protest in Seoul’s streets contrasted sharply with the deep tremors of the financial markets—an apparent crisis on the surface masking the silent maneuvers of global capital.









* The U.S. Embassy in Seoul issued a warning, accusing South Korea of “undermining market freedom” and hinting it would take necessary measures to protect American interests.

* Divisions inside the Korean government deepened: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged negotiation with Washington to avoid escalation, while the Ministry of Economy insisted on defending the won’s stability and halting capital flight.

* In his study, Erkez kept recording the unfolding events, murmuring to Roya:

  > “This is the clash between institutions and market forces. On the surface it looks like a sovereign state making decisions, but in reality, all America has to do is issue a *statement*, and the market falls in line.”

* Roya gripped her notebook tightly, a wave of helplessness rising in her chest:

  > “Do they really control everything? Ordinary people can’t even control their own trades.”

* Erkez shook his head:

  > “Control isn’t about every individual’s daily life. It’s about market signals, transaction pathways, and asset flows. The battlefield is in places you can’t see.”

* The unrest in Seoul’s streets unfolded in parallel with the quiet shifts of global financial data, forming a stark and silent contrast.










The South Korean government quietly instructed its ambassadors in Japan and China to push for a yuan-backed stablecoin settlement network among China, Japan, and Korea—an attempt to build an economic buffer zone beyond USDT’s full control.

* In high-level meetings, lawmakers and diplomats from Korea and Japan responded enthusiastically, helping to advance both policy and technical frameworks.
* Two weeks later, several key figures suffered sudden “accidental deaths”—a car crash, a cardiac arrest, a mysterious incident. On the surface they were unrelated, but the timing and identities were far too sensitive.
* While analyzing the news reports, Erkez fell into a long silence. He realized: **any attempt to bypass the dollar or USDT would inevitably brush against the hidden guardians of the global financial order.**
* Roya looked at him and whispered:

  > “Does this mean… every countermeasure is doomed to fail?”
* Erkez said nothing, only clenched his fists, as the flashing headlines on the screen glimmered like a cold omen—
  **The currency war is inescapable.**









### **Chapter Four: The U.S. Military Takeover in Korea**

* September 2026 — The U.S.–ROK Combined Forces Command clause was officially enacted: in the event of a financial or political emergency, wartime operational control would be fully transferred to the United States.

* U.S. military bases in Korea spanned across the peninsula—around Seoul and in key port regions like Busan and Ulsan—forming a near-total coverage network.

* Internal meetings within South Korea’s Ministry of Defense revealed that while it was nominally “joint command,” in practice the U.S. held dominance over communications, logistics, and strategic decision-making.

* In his study, Erkez noted: **The fusion of financial crisis and military power meant that although actions appeared to be led by Korea, in reality the country was already embedded within the U.S. command chain.**

* At the same time, South Korea’s financial regulators attempted to freeze USDT transactions, only to discover that the origin of capital flows was impossible to trace. U.S. military drills, coupled with network surveillance, seemed to verify market reaction speeds in near real-time.

* Roya, staring at the screen, whispered:
  “So even if the Korean president wanted to protect the nation, the army isn’t really his?”

* Erkez nodded:
  “It isn’t the visible command authority that decides the battle—it’s whoever controls the signals of information and finance, pulling the strings from the shadows. That’s the true takeover.”









* U.S. forces stationed in Korea bypassed the nominal joint command mechanism, unilaterally deploying elite units to encircle the Blue House’s core area.

* The South Korean president was placed under de facto house arrest inside his office, unable to move freely or issue decisive financial orders.

* In his study, Erkez wrote: **On the surface the nation still functioned, but its core authority had already fallen into foreign hands; the fusion of finance and military power amounted to a de facto “shadow takeover.”**

* Public opinion remained unaware. Ordinary citizens only felt the turbulence of markets and the confusion in the media, never realizing that the true chain of command had already been rewritten.

* Roya clutched her laptop tightly and whispered:
  “So the stability people see… is nothing more than an illusion maintained by outside power.”

* Erkez calmly replied:
  “Exactly. The real power games are always decided in silence.”









* South Korea’s military leadership was forced to accept the “protection plan” proposed by U.S. Forces Korea—nominally to prevent social unrest, but in practice amounting to a de facto military takeover.

* Access to major command posts, communication nodes, and financial hubs was redistributed, with the U.S. military directly seizing control of the decision-making core.

* In his manuscript, Erkez wrote: **The façade of the state still functioned, yet its core authority had already slipped away. The public perceived only the surface stability of order being maintained.**

* Staring at the news on the screen, Roya softly questioned:
  “Are they really protecting… or replacing?”

* Erkez did not answer immediately. He knew this kind of takeover was an art of silence—appearance, law, and public opinion all serving as cover, while the true game unfolded only in the hands of a few.









* Erkez stared at the screen, his finger hovering over the mouse, unable to click. Deep down, he knew: **the predictions in the novel were unfolding one by one in reality.**

* Roya sat beside him, clutching her laptop tightly, and whispered:
  “Did you… really know this would happen all along?”

* Erkez shook his head, calm yet heavy-hearted:
  “Not ‘know’—only that the simulations showed a very high probability… We’re merely recording the trend.”

* He drew a deep breath, eyes fixed on the headline—martial law around the Blue House, U.S. command authority temporarily in control, street order seemingly stable, while economic and political autonomy were being quietly eroded.

* A chill rose within him: **Reality had mercilessly confirmed every path the novel had foreseen.**









### **Chapter Five: The Currency Abolition Decree**

* The Bank of Korea tried to stabilize the won through foreign exchange market interventions, but the surge in USDT circulation rendered traditional measures ineffective.

* Public blockchain data revealed that USDT trading volume had doubled within just a few weeks, covering nearly all large-scale and cross-border transactions in South Korea.

* Companies and citizens widely shifted to USDT for wages, rent, and purchases; the won was reduced almost solely to small change.

* **Narrative focus**: National monetary sovereignty was rapidly marginalized, and the traditional control of the financial system had vanished.

* Erkez stared at the screen, a chill rising within him: **the boundary between novel and reality had completely blurred.**

* The U.S. Treasury officially issued a statement: **“Given the severe limitations on the circulation of the won, the United States recognizes USDT as a temporary currency in South Korea.”**
  The atmosphere in the South Korean presidential office was tense. The won’s trading screens flashed red, numbers pulsing like a heartbeat, as every foreign exchange operation failed.

The White House press secretary stood at the podium, smiling yet cold:
*"The United States recognizes that USDT may function as a temporary currency in the South Korean market. This is the result of spontaneous market choice."*
Her words were like an iron gate, wrapping reality in official phrasing.

Reporters’ hands trembled as they raised microphones, pressing on whether the U.S. had participated in operations. The press secretary’s tone was measured and calm:
*"U.S. policy remains neutral, respecting market mechanisms."*
Yet a flash of icy resolve flickered in her eyes—every explanation was only a façade.

The president’s private assistant typed stiffly at the keyboard, a brief X post going live:
*"USDT is now the temporary currency of South Korea."*
Each word pierced like an ice needle—beneath the surface, national sovereignty had been utterly coerced.

Outside, streets appeared calm, citizens busy as usual, unaware that the ruins of the won were quietly taking shape and that America’s hand had already reached into their daily lives. Cold, silent, yet more terrifying than any war.

Inside the National Assembly, lawmakers’ arguments filled the hall, but they could change nothing. Trading data streamed across screens like a flood, the market value of the won being devoured by USDT at staggering speed.

Within hours, bank counters closed, ATMs flashed the USDT logo, and all payment terminals, corporate ledgers, and payroll systems automatically switched. Citizens had no time to react—daily economic activity had already been locked into the new currency system.

Global financial markets reacted instantly, news headlines flashing: **“South Korea Abolishes National Currency: USDT Replaces Legal Tender.”** Analysts were shocked, investors panicked—history was being written before their eyes, yet no one could intervene.

This was more than a financial event; it resembled a silent military operation. Power had no smoke, yet it completely rewrote the nation’s economic sovereignty. Under the guise of decentralization, it was in fact the most centralized form of control. For the first time in history, the world witnessed a nation forcibly replaced by a “decentralized currency.”










The night pressed down on Seoul like lead, the neon lights of the streets flickering but giving off no warmth. On the large screens of the exchanges, the won’s exchange rate against the dollar leapt in an instant, while USDT trading volumes surged like a tide, draining one family’s savings after another every second. The banking system collapsed; ATMs spat out blank receipts, and long queues of people at the counters stood dazed and terrified.

In the Blue House conference room, harsh lights illuminated the pale faces of high-ranking officials. The president’s hand trembled slightly on the table, but he could only mechanically repeat, “We are cooperating with the international currency market.” Messages of protest from the UN Security Council flickered on the screen, powerless as air, their echoes swallowed up entirely.

Roya sat on the sofa in the corner of the study, clutching her laptop, eyes fixed on Erkez, her voice low and desperate:
*"Our book… is it just a powerless witness? We foresaw all of this, yet cannot stop it?"*

Erkez leaned back in his chair, fingers lightly tapping the desk, his gaze calm and icy:
*"No, Roya. This book… it is not powerless—it is a coordinate system."* He paused, looking out at the glittering city lights, as if surveying the entire world.
*"The paths we wrote down trace every move of America. An empire that can be predicted… will ultimately destroy itself."*

Roya’s shoulders trembled slightly, and she whispered,
*"But South Korea… they are already powerless to resist."*

Erkez closed his eyes, voice lower still:
*"The economy has been digitally colonized, politics manipulated by shadow powers—this is modern warfare. Ordinary people cannot see the trajectories, only panic and loss. But history will always record it; paths can be understood, and used by the future."*

Outside, the wind rattled the window glass; the city seemed to hold its breath. Roya placed her laptop on her lap, lifting her eyes to Erkez, a flicker of understanding crossing her face—calm, clear, yet imbued with the cruelty of history. The two remained silent; only the soft clatter of keyboards and the low moan of the night wind through the window cracks filled the room.

Seoul sank deeper into the night. The streets remained brightly lit, but all order had vanished. Digital currency flowed like a flood; the people sought only stability and convenience, unaware that **sovereignty was quietly dissolving, and the nation could no longer defend itself.**









### **Chapter Six: Predestined Crime and Merit**

**Roya (simulated interview):**
*"I’ve studied the on-chain data—USDT is buying massive amounts of U.S. medium- and long-term treasuries. Theoretically, that channels dollars back to support U.S. debt. But here’s the issue—doesn’t this strategy rely too heavily on the U.S. Treasury and on market confidence?
If the market starts doubting USDT’s reserves, wouldn’t that directly trigger fluctuations in treasury yields, maybe even a credit crisis? Isn’t this basically gambling with the entire global financial market?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"You have to understand—whatever form war takes, it never escapes one core truth: *‘crime belongs to the present, merit to the ages.’*

People say the Iraq War was about oil. But in reality? Much of Iraq’s oil ended up in the hands of British Petroleum. The real crux wasn’t the oil wells, but the currency in which that oil was priced.

Iraq decided to price its oil in euros. That—let me stress—*that* is the ‘serious suspicion’ that lit the fuse for the entire war. The U.S. dragged Europe into the conflict, yet the command chain stayed firmly in American hands. Whenever European forces tried acting independently, they often found themselves the victims of so-called U.S. ‘friendly fire errors.’ Was that coincidence? Or structural inevitability?

So yes—you can doubt anything, and markets can doubt anything. But once that doubt involves a sovereign state, the logic flips entirely. The link between legal risk and market expectation breaks down. Who prosecutes a sovereign state? Who gathers the evidence? Who files the case? Who judges? Who enforces the verdict?

At that level, the only thing still functioning is market expectation—not legal risk."\*

**Roya:**
*"So what you’re saying is, as long as the U.S. Treasury and the Pentagon stand behind it, market confidence isn’t really confidence—it’s manufactured?"*

**Erkez:**
*"Exactly. That isn’t confidence—it’s ‘battlefield discipline.’ Investors think they’re betting, but in truth, they’re obeying."*









**Roya:**
*"If the market fails, then U.S. treasuries are no longer economic logic, but military logic? Does that mean the whole world isn’t really buying debt, but paying tribute?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"Now you understand. America’s only true ally is the military-industrial complex. Every one of its units is tightly bound to it. You think the United States is a country, but in truth, it is a quasi-military empire. Its structure resembles the Mongol Empire.

In the Mongol Empire, every tribe, every camp was tied directly to war. In the U.S., every social unit functions as a quasi-military unit.

The American farmer you see isn’t just a farmer. He’s more like a CEO—producing not merely crops, but logistical supplies, even frontline munitions. The weaponization of food was already completed in the last century.

Remember? The U.S. launched three food wars against China in the 20th century—and won overwhelmingly each time. That’s just the most obvious example. The essence of American society is a pirate ship, where every crew member is a combatant. If you’re looking for ‘pastoral players,’ sorry—on this ship, they don’t exist."\*

**Roya:**
*"So U.S. treasuries are like the ‘loot ledger’ of the ship? Everyone who pays in is a crew member, whether they like it or not?"*

**Erkez:**
*"No—they’re the ballast stones. As long as the ship keeps raiding, the stones keep it stable. But the moment the ship stops, everyone will be dragged to the bottom of the sea."*







**Roya:**
*"If everything runs on military-industrial logic, then why bother disguising it as market logic? If it’s war, why wear the mask of economics?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"Because market logic is war logic—you’ve just been kept in the dark. The fiercest battlefield isn’t in the hail of bullets, it’s in the options market. That’s the real zero-sum game—high leverage, risk shifted one hundred percent, life and death balanced on a line.

What you see as trades, quotes, interest rates—they’re nothing but smoke screens. The market isn’t an exchange, it’s a front line without gunpowder. Every order, every hedge, every bond is a bullet. For someone to win, someone else must lose. For one nation to stand, another must fall."\*







**Roya:**
*"If the market is a battlefield, does that mean even every small trade ordinary people make is a form of passive conscription?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"Exactly. On a battlefield, retail traders can still make money—but it depends on which front you’re on. The U.S. market is built as a slow bull and a fast bear, with national innovation as its backstop. Most of the time it fits neatly into the market models you believe in. Retail traders profit on the long uphill climb, and then get wiped out in an instant when the crash comes. That isn’t chance—it’s by design.

But once sovereign wealth funds step in, trying to extract large-scale arbitrage from U.S. markets, the intelligence systems light up red. That’s no longer market activity—it’s a signal for state-level predation. The U.S. military-industrial complex will never allow foreign governments to use their citizens’ pensions or health funds to arbitrage in America and subsidize their own budgets. They will hunt sovereign funds directly.

And when those funds are trapped and bled dry, foreign treasuries are left to announce pension shortfalls, healthcare shortfalls, and then turn the blame on their people—‘you refuse to have children, you’re dragging down the system.’ The real chain—insurance, investment returns, coverage—gets severed under U.S. predation. And no one dares to say it out loud."\*






**Roya:**
*"If even sovereign wealth funds get harvested in the U.S., what financial security do other countries have? Are all non-U.S. nations doomed to be prey?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"You can look at the negative oil prices during the pandemic. On the surface, it seems like a market anomaly, but in reality, it was the direct consequence of sovereign funds cashing out in the U.S. That means what? It means they weren’t trading normally—they were siphoning U.S. wealth directly to support their own systems.

Could the U.S. allow that? No. Negative oil prices were a signal of predation—a message from America to the world: ‘If you dare to extract wealth from me, prepare for the market to crush you.’

Don’t forget, the logic of the U.S. market is military logic. You might think it’s just buying and selling commodities and capital, but to them, it’s no different from an enemy army hauling away your rations and seizing your ammunition. Sovereign funds aren’t just investors—they’re potential enemy quartermasters. Between prey and adversary, there’s only a thin line."\*








**Roya:**
*"If even financial markets can turn into battlefields at any moment, what’s left of a nation’s ‘sovereignty’? Is everything an illusion except military hard power?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"What is national sovereignty? It’s not an abstract flag—it’s the vehicle for maximizing collective interests.

If a country earns large amounts of dollars through exports to the U.S., then uses those dollars to arbitrage in the American market, siphoning more wealth and turning the U.S. slow bull into a fast bull, what happens?

Ordinary Americans lose the tools to protect themselves against inflation. Their saved pensions, purchased insurance, even mortgages, can evaporate in violent market swings.

In other words, the U.S. must treat this kind of ‘arbitrage’ as an act of war. Because if it’s allowed, the internal circulation of dollar hegemony would be pierced, and the domestic social structure would collapse. Sovereignty is nothing else—it’s the right to keep your collective alive in this zero-sum struggle."\*









**Roya:**
*"Does that mean that as long as a nation’s actions don’t align with U.S. interests, its sovereignty is merely a temporary illusion? That anyone who dares to challenge the foundation of the dollar is instantly treated as an enemy?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"Exactly. Assassinations, subversions, color revolutions, localized wars… all can happen without hesitation.

You have to understand, interfering with the dollar settlement system is not an economic dispute, nor a diplomatic friction—it’s treason. And treason comes with the price of national annihilation.

The foundation of the dollar is the throne of the empire. Whoever dares to touch it, the empire will, like ancient Rome, ruthlessly reduce their cities to ashes."\*









**Roya:**
*"If even the dollar is a throne, then globalization and free trade—aren’t they just a disguised ‘imperial market game’?"*

**Erkez:**
\*"Globalization is merely a marketing term—a pretext for low-cost global dumping.

And free trade, in essence, guarantees low-cost operations. That’s why U.S. aircraft carriers can sail to your doorstep, supposedly to ‘protect trade freedom.’

Europe? They’ve always used another concept—‘environmental protection’—to block U.S. companies from entering European markets. That’s the double standard. The rules are for show; the real war occurs simultaneously on economic and military fronts."\*










(Night has fallen like lead over the streets . The shadows of the two stretch long across the walls under the study’s light. Sirens occasionally wail outside. On the screens, the KRW–USDT exchange rate flickers. Roya looks up, her gaze calm, professional, but questioning.)

**Roya:**
*"In situations like Turkey or Korea, you write it as if ‘the nation falls while the people remain unaware.’ But in reality—once the currency’s functional space is disrupted, wouldn’t there immediately be withdrawal queues, panic buying, and street protests? The international community would respond too—sanctions, frozen assets, even military deterrence. My question is: does your scenario of the U.S. fully taking over a nation’s economy via USDT underestimate the complexity of popular resistance, black markets, and international countermeasures?"*

Erkez picks up his pen and writes a line on the whiteboard: **“The question is not whether there will be resistance, but how the resistance occurs.”** He taps the pen on a point, his gaze measuring the gaps in time.

**Erkez:**
*"Let’s start with the most direct technical perspective—when a large number of people sell their fiat for USDT, the immediate effect is **local currency being sold off, the exchange rate weakening**. That’s step one, the key to creating a vacuum. Now, there are two types of resistance: one is using state reserves or state-owned banks to exchange USDT back into local currency to support the rate; the other is grassroots efforts via black markets, OTCs, or market makers to buy up local currency and push the rate back up."*

(He draws two arrows: **Sell → Depreciate**; **Buy back → Support**.)

**Erkez:**
*"Your idea of ‘selling local currency for USDT, then buying back at depreciation to push the rate higher’ is theoretically feasible—but only if you **control the liquidity backend**. The critical factor is who can buy a large amount of local currency in a short time at better-than-market conditions. That requires massive foreign reserves, reliable market-making channels, and extremely fast execution. Sovereign funds or national banks can try, but it means mortgaging reserves to act as the backstop."*

**Roya** (pointing out the contradiction):
*"Isn’t that self-harm? The state uses reserves to prop up the currency, depleting its foreign assets, raising political costs. Wouldn’t such a counterattack risk an even bigger collapse of social trust?"*

Erkez nods slightly:
*"Exactly. Resistance has costs—and windows. Imagine when the digital redemption chain breaks, a ‘redemption gap’ appears—you might only get half the fiat at the official rate. The remaining gap must be bought on the black market or covered by issuers. If the state uses reserves to patch it, it only postpones the problem: when reserves hit bottom, consequences are harsher. Social response first shows up in withdrawal lines, shrinking pension accounts; political pressure erupts—protests, government changes, external finger-pointing are all natural outcomes."*

(He sketches a skull-shaped arrow, indicating political risk.)

**Erkez:**
*"One more thing—you must understand: USDT is just a platform, a brand; it isn’t the only stablecoin. If one market maker or stablecoin is ‘taken out,’ it doesn’t mean the invasion is over. Alternatives will rapidly fill the void. For a nation with deep intelligence and military–financial coordination, the key isn’t a single company—it’s the **network of financial channels**: offshore accounts, OTC traders, state funds moving in the shadows. Destroy one is like pulling a mushroom from the grass; others will regrow after the rain."*

**Roya:**
*"So can popular resistance or international sanctions decisively stop it? Could external pressure force the invasion back?"*

**Erkez** (voice hardening):
*"External pressure matters, but it’s a **battle of time and cost**. Sanctions, asset freezes, legal suits take time, while currency warfare is instantaneous, programmable. More importantly, how do you define ‘invasion’? When everything is cloaked as ‘market choice’ and ‘technological innovation,’ who collects evidence? Who dares to sue a counterparty with formidable intelligence, financial, and military coordination? Even if you win, enforcement may be nullified by countermeasures."*

(He pauses, looking at Roya.)

**Erkez:**
*"Finally, social resistance is part of the battlefield, but it’s not an automatic stop mechanism—it’s an **exposure window**. When people protest or queue at banks, it creates two opportunities: one for resistors—state or private actors using reserves, laws, or network shutdowns to stabilize; and one for hunters—using liquidity gaps during the chaos to harvest. Who wins depends on who can control short-term liquidity and information longer."*

(He puts away the pen, tone grave.)

**Erkez:**
*"So when we write scenes of ‘the nation falls while the people remain unaware,’ it’s not denying resistance exists—it emphasizes **the methods and costs of resistance**. In this system, resistance isn’t just marching on streets or calling for international support—it requires sufficient liquidity backends, alternative settlement networks, and diplomatic–military hard support; otherwise, resistance accelerates the collapse rather than halting it."*

(Roya falls silent. Outside, the city lights flicker in the distance. Both understand: resistance is possible, but the costs and timeline make every choice a gamble on a knife’s edge.)











(The map is spread across the table, red and blue sticky notes marking Central Asia, the Black Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Neon lights outside fracture the city’s silhouette; inside, only the two of them breathing and the flickering numbers on the screen.)

**Roya** raises a finger to a corner of the map, her tone direct and professional:
*"I admit your strategic vision is impressive—Central Asia, the Turkic sphere, the First Island Chain, Latin American buffer zones… But there’s a technical question for real-world implementation: can China, the U.S., Russia, and other players actually connect a stablecoin network to these countries in a short timeframe? Can mid-sized nations like Kazakhstan or Mexico realistically have the capacity and willingness to become buffer zones quickly? Regulatory issues, cross-border compliance, taxation, foreign exchange controls—these aren’t so easily bypassed."*

Erkez smiles calmly, tapping his pen three times on the paper:
\*"Your skepticism is professional. Let’s look at it in two layers: first, ‘can they?’ second, ‘will they?’

‘Can they’ depends on whether there exists an **activatable ‘middleman culture’** and foundational trade nodes. The Turkic world has been middlemen along the Silk Road for millennia: controlling stations, handling heavy cargo distribution and endorsement, repackaging goods, repricing, and transferring risk and information gaps. Historically, East-West trade wasn’t direct ship-to-ship—the middlemen set prices and flows. Transplant that logic to the digital era, and the Turkic regions naturally can treat stablecoin settlements as a new ‘station’ business. In other words, they have the culture and experience to position themselves as intermediaries rather than passive subjects—this gives them a social and commercial basis for rapid integration."\*

He pauses, turning to the Mexico sticky note:
*"Mexico is different. It lacks that cross-regional middleman tradition, and it doesn’t have the industrial or geopolitical nodes to support large-scale external settlement substitutes in the short term. Geographically close to the U.S., its supply chain is tightly bound to American industry; its internal industrial structure and financial elasticity are not equivalent to Central Asia’s hub lifestyle. So, Mexico is more likely to adopt a **coerced integration**—passively accepting to survive—rather than proactively becoming an independent, respected buffer zone."*

Roya frowns slightly:
*"So only countries with historical intermediary roles qualify as buffers?"*

Erkez shakes his head:
*"Not entirely. The second layer is ‘willingness and external influence’: government resolve, local elite coalitions, and instant external capital and technical support can turn a country that initially ‘lacks conditions’ into a buffer. But the costs differ: voluntarily engaged countries with cultural foundations retain more negotiation leverage; passively integrated countries often cede more sovereignty for short-term stability."*

He circles a finger over the map, as if marking a hunting ground:
*"So the rapid integration in the story doesn’t happen out of thin air—it relies on the convergence of three factors: one, **cultural/historical intermediary traditions** (like Turkic states); two, **geopolitical and port/transit advantages** (ports, transit taxes, logistics networks); three, **instant external injection of capital and technology**, assisted by cooperation from local political elites. Miss any one of these, and integration either carries huge costs or becomes impossible in the short term."*

Roya clicks open a screen, pointing to a set of numbers:
*"So in the story, Kazakhstan can act as a buffer, but Mexico is more likely to be absorbed by coercive integration?"*

Erkez looks at her, eyes firm and cold:
*"Exactly. If Kazakhstan proactively uses a ‘two-way exchange’ strategy, it can position itself as a multilateral settlement hub, earning fees and political space. Mexico, if coerced, pays the price with greater loss of economic sovereignty. What the story needs to make clear is not that every country becomes a buffer, but **which countries have the conditions, which are forced, and which actively trade sovereignty to survive**. These three categories have different fates and dramatic tension."*

(A moment of silence fills the room. Roya places her hand on the edge of the map, as if weighing a heavy reality.)










(The city outside is deep in night, a silent map of lights. Roya pushes a printed page of on-chain transaction records to the center of the table, her fingers tapping the dense hash strings.)

**Roya:**
*"You always talk about ‘all-knowing ledgers’ and ‘algorithmic shielding’ as tools for information control—but on-chain transactions are public. Anyone with the skills can track addresses and flows. So why does this ‘all-knowing control’ not sound like a contradiction? Cross-border compliance, blockchain transparency—how does the novel cover up these real-world obstacles?"*

Erkez looks up at her, a cold gleam in his eyes from the night:
*"Good question—and where most outsiders get misled: **a public ledger ≠ readable identities; readable flows ≠ stoppable settlements.** Let me break it into two layers: technical, and political/legal."*

He writes two columns on the whiteboard: **On-chain transparency / Identity linkage; Settlement channels / Legal oversight.**

*"Technically,"* he continues, *"the blockchain is indeed a ‘public ledger,’ but it only records addresses and amounts. Linking addresses to real-world identities requires **KYC data, exchange databases, off-chain bank records**. Whoever controls these datasets, whoever can correlate them, can turn an ‘anonymous address’ into a living individual account. That’s what ‘all-knowing’ really means: not that the chain itself names you, but intelligence systems stitch together on-chain, off-chain, social graphs, merchant records. With hundreds of data sources pieced together, AI can infer your past, present, and even future economic activity."*

Roya nods, but asks:
*"Who can actually perform this stitching? Couldn’t an audit or a third party expose it?"*

Erkez smiles without warmth:
\*"Who has the data, who has access, who has legal immunity. In reality, there are three main paths to obscure or bypass on-chain transparency:

1. **Centralized channels**—most stablecoin and conversion operations still go through centralized exchanges (CEX), OTC desks, or bank clearing. Control these, and ledger ‘openness’ becomes a semantic game.
2. **Off-chain settlements**—using offshore banks, shell companies, and cross-border payment agents to hide dollar and fiat flows behind bank statements.
3. **Obfuscation tools**—cross-chain bridges, mixers, wrapped tokens, and complex derivatives can fragment and recombine funds quickly, delaying traceability."\*

He pauses, shifting to a harsher reality:
*"Even more brutal: **addresses that can be frozen on-chain, redemptions that can be recalled off-chain, fake liquidity on-chain**—these could all be deliberately designed by state-level operations. In practice, ‘decentralized’ vs. ‘centralized’ is not so clear-cut. Mechanisms like USDT are hybrids—partly relying on the public ledger, partly on market makers, banking channels, and redemption systems. Whoever controls this backend **controls actual settlement power**."*

Roya asks bluntly:
*"What about central bank digital currencies? You always say states hesitate to issue CBDCs because it means automatic sovereignty loss. Why is the technical effect so extreme?"*

Erkez pours tea, voice low:
*"Issuing a CBDC essentially connects every citizen’s economic activity directly to the state’s database. Technically simple: in a ‘permissioned chain’ or centralized ledger, every payment is identifiable, and the state can read, freeze, or tax at will. The problem isn’t feasibility—it’s that **doing so eliminates any buffer space**. The state’s gray areas, citizens’ trial-and-error, market self-repair channels—all are immediately constrained. At that moment, your sovereignty is ‘frozen’ by your own government with extreme transparency—external enemies needn’t siege the city, the population’s agency is stripped. Who wants to hand over that key that masks errors and protects a fragile society?"*

He closes the laptop, eyes fixed on her:
*"So when the novel says ‘all-knowing ledgers’ and ‘issuing equals national collapse,’ it’s not fearmongering—it’s logical. Public ledgers don’t guarantee fairness; **whoever can first stitch on-chain and off-chain data, control settlement channels, and dominate offshore pathways** can turn transparency into a tool, turning technical advantage into political power."*

Roya organizes her notes calmly, finally asking almost like a confession:
*"So this concealment—is it technological deception, or political magic?"*

Erkez answers in a low voice:
*"Both. Technology provides the method, politics provides immunity and channels. On the surface, you see a ‘decentralized’ narrative—but in reality, it’s a multi-layer **web of centralized channels, offshore law, and intelligence coordination**. That web turns transparency into order, and order into domination."*

The neon outside glows like a cold footnote; inside, the two shadows slowly converge, no longer allies on the same side.










(The night deepens. Roya props her chin in her hand, staring at Erkez as if trying to pull the last tether from him.)

**Roya:**
*"You ultimately tie currency wars to space civilization—I admit the image is striking, but the logic jumps too fast. Why must the Earth’s financial system go through a USDT war first to decide who gets to enter and allocate space resources? Isn’t there a more direct intermediate mechanism linking the two?"*

Erkez pauses for two seconds, as if rotating a massive model in his mind, then slowly shows her the gears one by one:

**Erkez:**
\*"You’ve been assuming a premise: that space is infinite, equal, and freely accessible. That’s not a premise; it’s a utopian fairy tale. Reality is cold—space is not an endless pool of resources. The scale of the solar system alone dictates extreme scarcity in logistics, time, and cost. More importantly—exploiting space resources requires first, long-term, stable, ultra-high capital investment; second, controlled industrial infrastructure and confidential R\&D environments; third, control over key personnel and launch sites. None of this is solved by a one-off transaction—it demands **long-term financial dominance** and **information control**.

Put operationally, it boils down to three intermediate steps:

1. **Long-term capital and issuance rights (financial chain)**

   * Launches, stations, mining, long-term maintenance—all require cash flow spanning decades, even a century. Whoever controls international settlements and reserves can issue long-term debt at lower costs to fund these projects. An entity that can continuously absorb global savings via stablecoins or quasi-sovereign tokens and lock them into space infrastructure is essentially putting `future purchasing power` into its own pocket.
   * Therefore, controlling global payments and reserves first (i.e., monetary hegemony) channels global surplus capital into your space program, not someone else’s.

2. **Industrial chain and technological barriers (supply chain control)**

   * The space industry is not a single-point technology; it’s a complex network from materials, engines, sensors, software, launch sites, to orbital control. Whoever controls settlements and trade channels can prioritize allocation of key components, restrict export substitutes, and lock other nations’ industrial upgrades via pricing and contracts. Financial priority immediately becomes real-world production priority.

3. **Information and secrecy (all-knowing as a blocking tool)**

   * Before accessing space, many countries need high-risk experiments and societal trial-and-error—nuclear propulsion tests, small-scale demonstration mining, long-term closed ecological experiments. If every transaction, equipment purchase, hire, or academic collaboration is monitored, algorithmically predicted, or publicly flagged, you cannot conduct these essential gray-area experiments.
   * This creates a “time-flow” effect: for monitored nations, societal innovation and rapid experimentation become luxuries. Governments hesitate to let companies experiment, research teams avoid edge technologies, investors shun long-term bets. The result: development is “time-slowed”—critical innovation windows are locked, forming the ‘black zones’ or buffer regions we describe in the book.

Looking at all three together—**financial control → industrial priority → information blockade**—it explains why currency wars become the prelude to space conquest. It’s not merely about claiming asteroid minerals; it’s about who first solidifies capital, industry, and information flows on Earth, thereby deciding future ‘interstellar allocation rights.’

You asked about alternative mechanisms? There are, but all pass through these three gates:

* Military occupation of launch sites is possible, but requires long-term garrisons and logistics at immense cost;
* International treaties or cooperative alliances can share resources, but only if you already have a voice and voting power—again determined by finance and industrial control;
* Technological self-sufficiency is possible, but demands long-term massive investment and protection from external financial pressures—something countries stripped of monetary sovereignty cannot achieve.

The final, harshest point: when a country is forced to integrate its economic activity into another’s ‘all-knowing ledger,’ it loses not just wealth and privacy, but **the freedom to experiment**—it cannot secretly develop new propulsion, test closed ecosystems, or quickly deploy sovereign resources for long-term gambles. Entering space is not a single launch; it’s a multigenerational bet. Whoever sets the rules first sits on the banker’s side."\*

He finishes speaking. The room is left with only the hum of the air conditioner and the glow of screens. Roya slowly inhales, as if drawing the entire order of a world into her lungs, then exhales.










(The night deepens. Outside, the neon lights flicker like cooled flames. The two sit face to face, printed budgets and blockchain screenshots scattered across the table. Roya’s gaze, sharp as a searchlight, fixes on Erkez.)

**Roya:**
*"You keep saying that the U.S. system can ‘secretly manipulate the world economy’ without being detected by internal or external audits. But in reality, aren’t there the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Congress audits and reports? Aren’t these institutions semi-transparent and supervised? Logically, how could this ‘covert control’ even exist?"*

Erkez is silent for a few seconds, tracing circles on his cup unconsciously. His voice is low and cold, like frost pressed down on a winter night:

*"Your doubt is reasonable, and it’s the first reaction of many outsiders. On the surface, there is indeed a visible audit system—public budgets, hearings, annual reports, GAO inspections. But that is only **part of the performance**, the part designed for domestic citizens and international perception."*

He slides a marked-up expenditure sheet across the table, pointing to a few blurred entries:

*"The key lies in three things: **classification, channels, disguise**. First, classification. Some budgets are labeled classified or intelligence—public reports only show totals or broad categories, not details. Second, channels—military, intelligence, and special projects often use special appropriations, secret accounts, authorized contractor networks, and companies tied to offshore jurisdictions. These financial paths are nearly impossible to fully trace in standard audits. Third, disguise—legitimate procurement items can conceal anything: research equipment, training supplies, logistical support, even ‘technical services.’"*

Roya furrows her brow:
*"You mean—even if someone audits, they’ll only see a bunch of compliant purchase orders and contracts?"*

Erkez chuckles lightly, humorless:
*"Exactly. Auditors will see contract numbers, vendor names, invoices, delivery records—all appearing as regular military procurement. For example, you might see ‘Mugs: \$1,200,000,’ ‘Screws and fittings: \$8,400,000,’ ‘Facility maintenance & hygiene equipment: \$3,000,000.’ These pass routine audits. But the contractors behind them could be a layered network—domestic middlemen, overseas shell companies, trusts in Cayman or other offshore jurisdictions—ultimately funding a project account classified as ‘national security exception.’ Congress sees the ledger, but not the deeper links."*

He pauses, a ghostly smile flickering in his eyes:
*"You ask where the money goes? On paper, it’s all screws and mugs. Ask further, and someone will say, ‘That’s for training supplies, that’s facility maintenance.’ The real answer exists only in a small circle between authorized intelligence and operational units. Even if someone later wants accountability, lawsuits and sanctions require evidence chains, judicial cooperation, and political will—which are exactly the parts easiest swallowed by ‘politics’ and ‘national security’ exemptions."*

Roya raises her hand, slamming last night’s list onto the table:
*"So any attempt to dig deeper is blocked by procedure? Congress, media, GAO—allowed to reach a threshold, then stopped?"*

Erkez’s voice softens, but each word strikes like stone on glass:
*"Yes. Superficial oversight exists, but substantive transparency is deliberately left blank in many key channels. Think of it as the modern state’s firewall: the visible part maintains legitimacy and trust, the hidden part ensures strategic maneuverability. Together, outsiders see a ‘transparent democratic machine,’ while the truly operational part runs through hidden backdoors in that machine."*

He closes the folder, his gaze sharp:
*"This is also why it’s so hard for judiciary or media to disrupt the structure alone. Revealing it requires transnational judicial cooperation, intelligence sharing, and enormous political cost. More realistically, when stakeholders, the military-industrial complex, and certain diplomatic strategies are intertwined, even discovered issues are often classified under ‘national security’—then everything is sealed. Where did the money go? In one sentence—it is placed outside visible compliance, categorized as ‘strategic expenditure’ beyond routine audit reach."*

Outside, the neon flickers off and on. Inside, only the two sets of breathing remain. After a long silence, Roya asks finally:
*"Then what oversight can we realistically expect? Or is this just the rule of the modern state machine—there’s performance, and there’s a black box?"*

Erkez replies softly, as if announcing a harsh truth:
*"You can expect partial oversight, but not full disclosure. It’s precisely this ‘performance + black box’ structure that allows modern powers to follow the rules on the surface while still maneuvering strategically in the shadows."*









(The night grows deeper; the study light hangs like a weary eye. Roya folds her hands, as if clutching the edge of a question, then finally lifts her head to ask.)

**Roya:**
*"You’ve been talking about technicalities and operational paths, but there’s a more fundamental question—why do states do these things at all? Is it pure power greed, or is there another reason? You often say that a state needs an ‘external enemy.’ Isn’t that a bit cold?"*

Erkez pauses, eyes drifting to the deserted street outside, searching for the right metaphor before speaking:

*"It’s not cold—it’s fact. You have to think of a ‘state’ as a large-scale organism—its purpose isn’t just to exist, but to prove and perpetuate a certain value. Individual life needs challenges and verification to evolve; groups are no different. Without external challenges, internal competition becomes a self-indulgent comfort zone. The drive to advance weakens when there’s no hostility or pressure."*

Roya presses further:
*"So you’re saying that as long as there’s an enemy, a state can stay vital? That’s… very dangerous."*

Erkez nods but does not shy away:
*"Danger is precisely its primary function. Any system facing external pressure will quickly optimize resources, accelerate technological innovation, and repair internal contradictions. Look at history—many empires evolved strong organization and institutions through long-term opposition; but once absolute advantage arrives, enemies are eliminated or assimilated, and internally it falls into complacency and rigidity. You must let the enemy live, even let them see and copy your path—this is protective. If you completely destroy your opponent, next time there’s no external reference; institutions close, innovation stalls, and the ultimate risk isn’t smaller than being defeated."*

A flash of protest crosses Roya’s eyes:
*"Are you excusing war? Aren’t we supposed to pursue permanent peace?"*

Erkez speaks calmly, like stating a natural law:
*"We all swear for global, permanent peace, but no one truly treats it as a viable strategy. Why? Because a large collective needs an ‘other’ to define itself, to validate its existence. Permanent peace means the disappearance of competition, the break of natural selection, and the paralysis of social incentive mechanisms. Life needs trials to confirm direction; the state is an extension of collective life. If you pin a state’s drive entirely on internal self-satisfaction, it will quickly lose reason to progress—this isn’t ethical justification, it’s political ecology."*

Roya is silent, eyes lowered, digesting an uncomfortable truth. Erkez continues, his voice carrying a near-melancholic clarity:

*"Civilization’s stability often originates from a black box—not every decision and action is publicly debated. The black box allows a state to mobilize quickly when needed, letting innovation fail and iterate in gray zones without public scrutiny. Open the black box, and trial costs are exposed; innovation is stifled. Conversely, states that accumulate experience, capital, and organizational strength in the black box gain the chance to launch the next round of technological and institutional output in ‘peacetime.’"*

He lowers his voice, like recounting an ancient irony:
*"Throughout history, how many empires, after annihilating their enemies, slid into decline? Don’t view collapse as merely external—it is more often because victory removed the necessary trials, the compulsion to change. Civilization doesn’t begin in sunlit, open forums—it is forged in black boxes, under pressure."*

The light from outside filters in, casting their intertwined shadows. Roya whispers:
*"Then what do we do? If this is the rule, how do we break it?"*

Erkez does not answer immediately; he speaks one sentence, half conclusion, half farewell:
*"Knowing the rules is the first step toward plotting. To change them, you first need to understand where the black holes in their operation are, then gradually embed transparency, accountability, and protective mechanisms. But in all this, you must soberly recognize: without an external enemy, the state machine will sooner or later consume itself."*











(The light remains dim, the air thick with the bitter scent of paper and coffee. Roya hasn’t fully absorbed the previous conclusion, as if trying to grasp some fragment of hope from history.)

**Roya:**
*"You just said the black box is necessary, but I can’t shake the feeling that black boxes are breeding grounds for conspiracy. Who supervises them? If no one does, they just keep expanding, swallowing all transparency."*

Erkez lifts a hand and taps twice on the folder lying on the table, his voice calm yet each word deliberate:
*"You need to distinguish two things. A black box **does not equal chaotic conspiracy**. It is an institutionalized ‘exception mechanism’—with historical reasons for its existence. Look back to the Hoover-era FBI: a near-pathological intelligence machine, many called Hoover a death god because he collected files that could destroy anyone. That generation’s black box had two traits: infinite accumulation and infinite opacity. Society later curbed that absolute black box through legislation, judiciary, and public opinion—but did not erase its existence entirely."*

He shifts his words:
*"The black box evolved. It became a layered, graded system with statutory exemptions and review processes: classified budgets, special access, SIPs (Special Access Programs), and time-limited declassification schedules. The records **exist fully**—that’s key. But ‘when they can be seen,’ ‘who can see them,’ and ‘what can be done after seeing’ are all set into a complex labyrinth by law and politics. Every so-called ‘declassification’ gives the public the illusion that the black box has opened; in reality, you only see an old crack, while new doors are embedded deeper. Just when you think you’ve reached the edge, the black box has already changed form."*

He pauses, eyes soft yet sharp:
*"Because the system knows it has this setup, it never fully trusts itself. It sounds contradictory, but it’s precisely modern states’ self-preservation logic: to maintain actionable power when necessary, while preventing abuse within a controllable range. Thus, two complementary forces emerge: **institutionalized audit and oversight** (attorneys general, inspectors, congressional hearings) and **external exposure forces**—investigative journalists, independent researchers, transnational judicial cooperation. The latter matters not to maintain a ‘democratic façade,’ but because the system itself admits it cannot solve all black box problems alone."*

Roya whispers:
*"But those journalists are in real danger, aren’t they? They get suppressed, marginalized, maybe worse."*

Erkez nods:
*"Yes, they pay the price. History teaches us that those who push for declassification often pay dearly. But precisely because of this, the future will need **more** investigative journalists, stronger cross-border media collaboration, and technical tools to piece together severed records. And because the system fears absolute control over itself, it occasionally releases limited declassifications and hearings, to periodically expose and recalibrate the black box’s power. Not because it wants trust, but because it fears distrust—without trust, it fails long-term, and that is fatal for power itself."*

He closes an old notebook, voice low like the last bullet:
*"So, the black box is both a tool of power and a vulnerability. Understanding it, questioning it, recording it—that is the work of your generation of journalists and our generation of observers. Civilization advances without dramatic daylight revelations; but without those lights, the black box quietly rewrites the future of civilization in someone else’s script."*

The wind brushes against the window like a footnote to his words. In the silence, the two measure the weight of what lies ahead, knowing that what they seek is not just a manuscript, but a far more dangerous—and necessary—responsibility.










(Roya watches Erkez in silence, as if waiting for a conclusion. But Erkez doesn’t speak immediately; he exhales softly, his tone carrying the weight of a shadow dredged from memory.)

**Erkez:**
*"I have a vague sense that America’s black box has evolved again. It is no longer the old form of ‘confidential files’ as mere shells of dead documents; it has become a **flowing shadow**. Amid these ghostly specters, I often think of Eisenhower’s farewell address—his 1961 warning about the military-industrial complex. But have you considered this? That speech itself might have been part of the black box. A warning doesn’t necessarily aim to stop—it may have been preemptively ‘filed,’ leaving legal cover for everything that comes after."*

He lifts his eyes, voice cold and hard:
*"Within sovereignty, capital is free—trade, investment, circulation—all protected under the illusion of a democratic market. Step beyond sovereign borders, and capital immediately becomes weaponized, transformed into state capitalism. The American black box survives precisely by toggling between these two logics: liberalism at home, predatory capitalism abroad."*

After a brief pause, Erkez adds softly:
*"And more frighteningly, I begin to see the concept of ‘cultural sovereignty’ emerging. In the past, sovereignty meant territory, currency, military. Now, the true black box seeks to hollow out culture. The loss of cultural sovereignty means what? It means you’re forced not just to use the dollar, rely on aircraft carriers, but to mentally, narratively, and morally accept: ‘This is the world’s rule.’"*

He lets out a light laugh, chilling rather than warm:
*"This is the highest level of black box. You think you still have choices, but even the language of doubt gradually slips away."*











**Roya** (her tone sharper than before, as if she suddenly caught a crack in reality):
*"If cultural sovereignty can be hollowed out, does that mean even resistance disappears? People would unconsciously accept America’s value system, treating it as the only narrative. Is that still a ‘sovereign nation,’ or just a vassal of the empire?"*

**Erkez** (a slight twitch at the corner of his mouth, like a cold smile, his voice low and grave):
*"Cultural sovereignty… it reminds me of the Mongol Empire. When they unified the tribes, the most important thing wasn’t the land, but making the nomadic groups submit mentally—emptying all tribal consciousness, leaving only the name ‘Mongol.’ That was naked, brutal military conquest."*

He pauses, eyes dark and cold:
*"But America is different. It refuses military invasion—not because it can’t, but because it doesn’t want to. Invasion means governance, and governance comes with costs. You have to station armies, build roads, feed the conquered population, and manage their hatred. Empires have perished under such burdens."*

He lowers his voice, almost as if speaking to himself:
*"America wants only the gains, not the costs. So it chooses a different path: monetary war. Through the dollar, through USDT, through financial derivatives, it slowly drains your lifeblood without decapitating you directly. Cultural sovereignty is gradually replaced in the process—you don’t even realize you’re being ruled; you just blame your own country’s incompetence amid inflation and exchange rate fluctuations."*

**Roya** (brows furrowed, speaking softly):
*"So… this isn’t colonization—it’s a colder form of slavery."*











**Roya** (her gaze piercing, each word deliberate):
*"If America refuses the costs of governance and seeks only gain, does that mean the world is being consumed by an ‘unaccountable empire’? An empire with no rulers, no obligations, only extraction?"*

**Erkez** (silent for a moment, as if weighing his words, then speaks slowly):
*"That… touches on the definition of ‘freedom.’ You can guess, but neither you nor I can openly admit it."*

He shifts perspective, with a trace of cold irony:
*"In the context of nomadic peoples, a free person is not someone who does as they please, but someone who owns cattle and sheep. Wealth is not gold or silver, but livestock. Livestock can reproduce themselves, migrate with the tribe—they are living capital. One without cattle or sheep is not free, but a slave, a servant."*

He lifts his eyes to Roya:
*"Today’s world is no different. Whoever controls ‘self-reproducing capital’ is the free person. America avoids responsibility because it only needs to herd. You think you hold your nation’s currency in free trade, but in reality, it’s just a pasture that can be taken away at any moment."*

**Roya** (voice lowered, trembling slightly):
*"So… the whole world… is being herded?"*

**Erkez** does not answer immediately.
He slowly lifts the cup on the table, but his fingers pause against its rim, as if forgetting the next step.
The air stretches taut, every second pressing like a stone on the chest.

Outside, the city lights flicker unpredictably.
Not warm illumination, but indifferent signals—every building, every street, invisibly calculated and marked.

Roya suddenly realizes that his silence is sharper than any answer.
A chill runs through her—not because Erkez is hiding something, but because—he doesn’t need to say anything at all.

She breathes softly, trying to break the oppressive weight, but her voice catches in her throat.
In the depths of her mind, a silent conclusion takes shape: **If civilization is truly just a herd, then everyone right now is nothing more than penned livestock.**








**Final Chapter**

**The Bench Conversation**

Afternoon sunlight filtered through the trees in Manhattan’s Central Park, scattering dappled patterns across the cobblestone path.
Pigeons pecked for food around the bench, joggers passed lightly by, and the city’s clamor rumbled in the distance.

Erkez sat on the bench, his fingers tapping lightly against the wood, thoughts in turmoil.
From afar, a familiar figure approached—it was his former supervisor, wearing a polite smile, though a trace of caution flickered in his eyes.

“Erkez, it’s been a long time.”
“It has, indeed.”
The exchange was brief, detached, yet the air carried a latent tension.

Erkez cut straight to the question that weighed on him:
“Will I be prosecuted?”

The former supervisor sat down, his gaze drifting over the strolling crowd before settling back on him.
“No,” he said slowly, his tone calm to the point of cruelty. “Your path has been appropriated, but the U.S. government will never acknowledge it. The ban on your novel will be lifted.”

Erkez frowned slightly, as if absorbing the gravity behind the words.
At last, he understood—his book had silently become a “memo” for policy.
And he himself was left without even the right to a signature.

The pigeons took flight again, skimming past the bench.
Erkez lifted his eyes to the sky, a complex, ineffable feeling rising within him:
**The work had been consumed, yet the thought still ran within the system.**

Sunlight lay warm and quiet across the bench, like a surface illusion of the city.
Beneath that calm, everything had already been quietly rewritten.









**The Ledger and the Illusion**

(The sunlight on the bench was fractured by tree shadows, the city’s noise receding into a distant hum.
The two sat close, like twin needles piercing the same map, yet pointing in opposite directions.)

The former supervisor folded a sheet of paper again and again, then handed it to Erkez.
On it was not a report, but a simple diagram: two columns of arrows. On the left, *“KRW → USDT.”* On the right, *“USDT → USD/offshore settlement.”*
Brief, yet enough to compress a complex world into a cold, linear path.

“You see,” the supervisor explained quickly, his voice low, “in actual circulation, the exchange between USDT and the Korean won isn’t just that one on-chain ‘hash.’ It’s completed through several parallel channels: centralized exchanges (CEX) tied into bank settlement, large OTC desks, fragmented P2P flows, and cross-border proxy payments through offshore accounts. On the surface, it’s a decentralized ledger. Underneath, it’s a fully centralized settlement network.”

Erkez tapped open his tablet. A few keywords flickered across the screen: *market makers, offshore channels, automated market-making, fiat gateways.*
He didn’t treat them as technical terms, but as hazard markers on a hidden map.

“These channels,” the supervisor went on, “move through the blind spots of international regulation and judicial cooperation: jurisdictions with asynchronous laws, AML and KYC enforcement that’s uneven, and offshore havens—you know the islands—that provide structured legal cover. International law exists, but enforcement is slow and costly. Without political will, the law is paper. So what we face is a dual world: the ‘ledger,’ and the *real books*.”

At last Erkez posed the question:
“Then—aren’t you afraid of international audits? After all, Koreans can buy USDT directly, and once it hits the chain everything’s transparent. In theory, it shouldn’t be so hidden.”

The supervisor looked at him with a calmness stripped of pity.
“No. You need to understand one simple fact: whose ledger would dare be audited if it belongs to the United States? When a nation’s fiscal and security apparatus can turn the ‘ledger’ into a strategic weapon, auditing ceases to be technical—it becomes political. Neither China nor Russia will treat this as moral accounting. They’ll just replicate the path, seize control of their allies’ monetary issuance. In other words, the international system already has a tacit consensus about this game: *act without saying, trade silence for interest.*”

He paused, as though waiting for the sunlight to dry the words:
“More practically, auditing requires cross-border enforcement, evidence exchange, judicial cooperation. All of these cost sovereignty and diplomatic capital. To prove in court *whose funds bought whose debt* would require another state to hand over its banking records, market-maker data, even intelligence. That almost never happens. So the ledger becomes an illusion—and the illusion is accepted as reality.”

Erkez looked at him, not with anger, but with a cold, calculating clarity.
“So the things I wrote, once appropriated into policy, at least leave us with lists and trajectories. Just not my name on them, right?”

The supervisor nodded faintly, his voice just as low.
“Exactly. You provided the coordinates, but not the right to sign the map. The ledger is reality—but the narrative belongs to those who define reality. The U.S. isn’t just writing accounts, it’s writing a *meta-narrative*—deciding which accounts matter, and which are dismissed as noise. Whoever controls the meta-narrative can turn the ledger into law and habit. The ledger becomes a mirror of power, and the mirror shapes how people imagine and accept the world.”

A flock of pigeons swept past. Sunlight drew a thin, cold line across their shoulders, as if urging their eyes away from paper and numbers, toward the glare itself.

The supervisor did not deny it, nor did he need to.
The city hummed behind them, the ledger blinked on-chain, while the real power whispered off-chain—hardening illusions into reality through legal borders, intelligence immunity, and narrative frames.










**Why Not Turkey**

Autumn sunlight lay clean across the wooden grain of the Central Park benches.
The city’s noise sifted through the wind, leaving only the dull drone of a distant subway.
Erkez kept his hands in his coat pockets, eyes fixed on the man across from him—his former supervisor, whose practiced calm barely veiled something sterner.

The supervisor lit a cigarette, only to stub it out at once, as if suppressing a reflex.
There was no small talk; the conversation plunged straight in.

“Why not Turkey?” Erkez cast the question, his tone stripped of sentiment—just a probe for fact.

The supervisor glanced toward the joggers in the distance, drew a long breath, and let the answer unravel in layers:
“You need to look at *Turkey* as a map—not merely as today’s republic with its borders. It’s a fragment of Ottoman inheritance, a relic of the empire that once stitched together the Europe–Asia–Africa trade triangle. That puzzle piece holds too many inlays: straits, ethnicities, religious networks, trade routes, and cross-regional webs of commerce and intelligence.”

He tapped the bench armrest with his knuckle, continuing:
“Geographically, Turkey sits on the throat of the straits—Bosphorus and Dardanelles. These aren’t mere waterways; they decide the energy and supply lines between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Who can move here casually? A tug on this thread sets off a whole body—any abrupt move would turn regional connectivity into staggering costs on the war-ledger.”

Erkez listened, waiting for a clean, pragmatic verdict.

The supervisor shook his head, his face more severe now:
“Turkey isn’t a single-ethnic, single-interest state. It’s more like a cluster of states: the merchants of Istanbul, the military-political core of Ankara, the tribes and minorities of the eastern plateau—each with its own self-defense reflex. Then there’s Turkey’s NATO role, its tangled duel with Russia, and its historical ties across the Middle East. Any outside force trying to ‘do something’ here isn’t just tweaking an exchange rate—it’s rewriting a network woven from a thousand years of history.”

He paused, his tone bearing the weariness of recognition:
“The more practical truth is this—Turkey cannot be moved ‘cleanly.’ Touch it, and you’re not moving one state, but triggering a chain of allied responses and interest collisions. Those reactions would be fast, uncontrollable, and ruinously costly. History has answered this many times: empires that tried to reconfigure such lands and passages ended not with stability, but with self-exhaustion.”

Erkez asked quietly:
“So Turkey, as a remnant of the imperial puzzle, becomes a forbidden zone?”

The supervisor nodded, a cold glint in his eye:
“Exactly. To treat Turkey as a single target is to underestimate history’s density and reality’s complexity. It carries cross-regional networks and layered identities. Any sudden external force tears those threads into shreds, unleashing ripples no one can contain. That’s not the kind of *controlled test ground* we seek. We want targets that can be quietly simulated, harvested through finance, information, covert channels—not a nerve cluster that bleeds at the first pull.”

He allowed a faint smile, devoid of warmth:
“That is why, in many strategic blueprints, Turkey is filed as a *too-sensitive* node. Touching it exacts costs that history itself tallies. What you face isn’t just military pushback or temporary resistance—it’s a civilizational echo: religion, ethnic fervor, the economic lifeline of the straits. These turn any intrusion or manipulation into a long, unpredictable struggle.”

Sunlight slanted through the treetops and fell between them.
Erkez sat silent for a long while, as if swallowing each word whole. Then, evenly, he said:
“I see. Turkey isn’t a country—it’s one among a cluster of countries. History here isn’t just dates on monuments. It’s a living thing, ready to answer back.”

The supervisor said nothing more.
They sat together, with the clamor of the city and the weight of unspoken calculations weaving behind them.
On the bench, sunlight and shadow lay side by side—like that puzzle piece: beautiful in its danger, and dangerously real.









**The Next Target**

The sunlight was thin and cold, filtering through sparse leaves into strips of light and shadow across the bench.
In the park, only the occasional jogger passed, while a flock of pigeons loitered unhurriedly. Half the city’s noise was swallowed by the canopy above.

The two sat side by side.
The former supervisor, in his trench coat, rubbed a coin whose edges had long been worn smooth.
Erkez fixed his eyes on the face across from him—a face practiced in hesitation and calculation—yet his own voice came out clean and sharp, free of probing or courtesy.

“Where exactly is the next target?” he asked.

The supervisor looked up at the distant outline of skyscrapers, as if gauging the wind, then slipped the coin back into his pocket. His reply was calm and exact:
“To contain the Russian threat to Europe, the United States has decided to reinforce its military presence there.”

Erkez narrowed his eyes, then pressed, his tone carrying both disbelief and urgency:
“Europe isn’t an ally?”

The supervisor let out a short laugh, but it was cold, like ice scoring glass:
“Ally? Don’t mistake words for guarantees. America’s only ally has always been the U.S. military. ‘Europe’ is nothing more than a political construct—a convenient diplomatic label. What actually decides outcomes is who can project force at the critical point, who controls logistics, intelligence, and financial conduits. Spoken treaties won’t pay your cost when it matters most.”

He paused, his gaze shifting past Erkez toward a taxi sliding slowly down the nearby path:
“Remember this—your target isn’t the seizure of one nation. It’s turning a whole ecosystem, one you can manage and harvest, into your reality. That’s called controllability. Turkey is too tangled, not worth the move now. What we need is a place with cracks—and with capacity. Only there can the next canvas be drawn.”

The silence on the bench grew colder under the wind.
Two sentences had said all that needed saying.
What remained was only the heavy arithmetic lingering in the air.









**Civilization and Belonging**

Sunlight dappled through the leaves, and the familiar bench in Central Park felt like a scene from an old film—aged, carrying both safety and a trace of dust. Around them, only the sound of distant traffic and the slow steps of passersby, as if the world had been pressed into a still frame.

The former supervisor looked older now. His hands folded together, as though clutching the secret of a long winter. Every breath Erkez took seemed magnified by the silence—he knew the question he was about to ask would never yield a simple answer.

“Your grandparents came to America—wasn’t it because they thought this place was better for you?” The supervisor spoke first, his tone free of probing, carrying instead a calm that was both invitation and reminder.

Erkez did not reply at once. A draft slipped through the branches, brushing the grass into a faint rustle. He thought of the names on his grandparents’ immigration papers, the photos from the old world, his parents’ awkward smiles stretched between two cultures. The markets of Turkey, the steps of Athens, the squares of Washington—fragments tugged at him like magnets, each pulling in a different direction.

“America is the country with the highest migration rate in the world—higher even than Mongolia.” The supervisor’s voice carried an odd certainty. “Surely you don’t believe American culture is just an extension of Europe?”

The words cut like a blade, stripping away the last numb layer of his identity. Erkez wanted to protest—that he was neither fully Turkish, nor purely Athenian, nor could he be simply filed under some American category. But the words stuck in his throat. Labels felt hollow. Migration rates, cultural roots—these were cold statistics, testimonies that explained neither his belonging nor the restless path he had taken.

The supervisor’s gaze softened suddenly. “Come back. The position has always been kept for you.”

The words carried no warmth, only the measured temperature of calculation. It was like an unsigned blank check: return, and reclaim the identity and stability once his; stay outside, and remain the novelist, a man whose work would be quietly exploited or easily forgotten. The position meant security—but also a door that could never again be closed. Behind it lay secrets, orders, sanctioned silences, and forbidden truths.

Inside him, Erkez felt the pull of two forces. On paper, he had dissected the world like a machine, rearranging it coldly into words. But reality surged like a tide: his novels used as roadmaps, his predictions turned into strategies, his name erased while others acted on his words. Now, this invitation—this transaction—stood in his hands.

He closed his eyes. The book cover flashed before him, its title stark and simple, followed by the hollow echo of its stalled publication. The system wasn’t calling him back for honor—it wanted his silence, his knowledge folded into its ledger. To return was to participate. To stay away was to remain an observer—but an observer whose work would always be turned into action by others.

The bench’s shadow stretched long. The supervisor tapped his thigh lightly, as though counting down an unspoken clock.

“Go back?” Erkez finally broke the silence, his voice low and steady.

The supervisor did not answer at once. His silence was a seal, an unsigned contract. Then he smiled, a smile that carried both pity and calculation.
“There are many ways to write, Erkez. Inside the system, you can write too—only then, your words will wear someone else’s name. Outside, the risks are higher; inside, the impact is greater. Choose.”

The choice lay naked before him, like two branching roads: return to the hall of light and surrender part of himself, or stay on the margins, keeping clarity but losing the way back. The line between novel and reality blurred—the storms on paper had become weapons in his hand, sharp enough to wound.

Erkez studied the profile of his former supervisor, and inside he heard the slow turn of unseen gears. He gave no reply. The wind rose again, carrying off the faint sound of rustling leaves—and with it, the last tremor of uncertainty before a decision.








**Almaty Secret Meeting**

In the Tianshan Mountains, where Almaty rests, a subterranean fortress nestled between sheer cliffs beat like a silent heart, untouched by the blizzards outside. In the early spring of 2028, the air was dry and cold; the valley echoed with faint gusts of wind, as if playing the overture for the gathering.

The conference room was spacious but frigid, its walls clad in gray metal panels. LED light reflected off the LCD screens placed on each table. Delegations from China, the United States, and Russia entered with tightly woven security teams. The flag of the Turkic Organization drooped in one corner; Mongolia’s representatives sat in silence, wary like the descendants of nomads; the Israeli delegation’s sharp eyes scanned every document.

The American delegation filed in with precise formation. Their flag stood at the table’s edge, name cards aligned in rows. Erkez sat in the **second row of the U.S. side**, close to the technical desk, his badge bearing a barcode and a dark identification chip—no title, no affiliation, yet granting him access to every hall and every data port.

The main screen cycled through partitions: **Global Settlement Path Simulation, Energy Corridor Risk Matrix, Orbital Launch Windows and Hedging Models**. He did not speak; instead, he handed **revised parameter sheets** to the lead representative, slipping in short notes on sticky tabs to mark the boundary conditions of certain assumptions. When required, he unfolded the “emergency channels” of the model—a page whose headings mirrored the chapter titles from his novel, though now renamed *Standard Operating Attachment (SOP-A).*

Across the table, delegations whispered over figures; the faint rustle of paper was swallowed by the heavy air. At a critical moment, the U.S. lead glanced back, pausing briefly on him. Erkez understood. He adjusted the simulation, **shifting the “Secondary Liquidity Backstop—Cross-Border Stablecoin Swap (Long-Term Curve)” to a more conservative gradient**, and slid forward a small card marked **“Social Friction Threshold—72-Hour Window.”** The lead nodded and resumed negotiation.

He knew it well: this was no longer observation—**he was back inside the system.** His placement was exact—not the first row of political pledges, not the third row of logistical support, but the **second row: the cog where policy and technology interlocked.** Each parameter tweak could decide whether a city faced a bank run; each narrowing of a “stability domain” could determine whether a sovereign state survived on paper.

At the close of the session, documents were bound into sealed envelopes, cataloged, signed, and withdrawn. The American delegation rose in unison. He followed them out, **without looking back.** He knew from now on, the sentences from his novels would live on as clauses, footnotes, formulas, and classified codes. **His name would not appear; the responsibility would not be his.** Within the system, he was nothing more than a replaceable interface—**yet the shape of that interface was carved by his own hand.**

The elevator ascended, steel walls mirroring the badge on his chest. For a fleeting moment, as the lights flickered, he realized: **he was no longer a writer, but a custodian of paradigms. And once a paradigm takes root, literature is reduced to nothing but a classified expiration date.**
