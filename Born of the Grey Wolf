Where Wolves Drink the Black Tide

Inscription · *The Fracture Oath

In the rift of time, there is a pen—
forged in the still-burning grasslands of war.
It writes not mere stories,
but the rise and fall of systems,
the echo of civilizations,
and the blood-bound oath of freedom.

We once drank the same bowl of fiery horse milk.
We once saw our brother's blade through the morning fog.
Among the ruins of faith,
we seek the unfulfilled vow of our ancestors:

“Mongolia shall have no emperor—only a system.”

This is not mere fantasy—
it is the reflection of history,
the prophecy of the future.
It is a war engine—
meant to be performed, sung, coded.
Yet it never lies;
it speaks truth in another form.

Curtains may rise in the theater,
screens may burn with image,
code may shape interaction—
but the blade of text always cuts first,
like the grassland wind cleaves the dawn,
like the crack in the system splits the empire.

What we write is not just a tale,
but a reminder:
When systems collapse,
and gods fall silent,
only rules remain—etched in blood.

Inscribed in the Year of the Fracture,
written by you and me together.
Now that the Oath is spoken—let the world tremble.




"Cities are like flowers, blooming at the peak of civilization—
so breathtakingly beautiful, so intoxicatingly poisonous.
Those who rush toward the flames, like moths to fire,
spend a lifetime without ever attaining it.
The one they love lives far away in the countryside;
those who love them never make it into the city.
Skyscrapers are the bones, lights are the skin—
and life is but a grandly dressed funeral procession."




Reality One — [EXT. Frozen Heilongjiang River · Twilight Approaching]

Snow swirls across the sky, the northern wind cuts like a blade.
Temujin rides alone, his horse trotting slowly along the frozen Heilongjiang River.
The fur robe on his back flaps sharply in the wind, while each hoofbeat echoes crisply across the ice.
At this moment, the river is a boundless white wasteland, where the sky and earth blur into one —
as if the world itself were being devoured by the storm.

Suddenly, a low-hanging branch brushes the horse’s head, nearly knocking off Temujin’s hat.
He jerks back instinctively, barely regaining balance.
Beside him, his wife sways gently with the rhythm of the hooves,
but can’t help letting out a quiet laugh.
Her laughter dances lightly through the snowstorm, laced with warmth and playful teasing.

Temujin turns to glance at her, his expression calm,
but there's a flicker in his eyes — he knows her ease is unhidden, perhaps deliberate.
He says nothing, keeps riding in silence.
“You laugh at me like that?” he murmurs, his voice low —
carrying the faintest trace of threat, yet cloaked in tenderness.

She chuckles, leaning closer, replying in a whisper:
“You think yourself a king… but even a king can’t see his own disgrace.”

Temujin doesn't respond. He exhales, adjusting the cloak ruffled by the wind.
Even beneath the harshest snow and ice, he remains composed.
But this fleeting moment of quiet stirs something within him—
a memory of the hardships he once endured.
Back then, he had no power, no glory—only the weight of survival and duty.

“We are, even now… still who we were,” he whispers to himself,
his voice swallowed by the cold wind.

His figure slowly fades into the endless snow and ice,
as if he could vanish into the pale vastness at any moment.
The storm grows heavier.
Heaven and earth seem to wait for something.

The camera slowly pushes in —
Temujin's eyes grow distant, and memory takes hold.




[Memory · INT. Mongolian Steppe · Sunrise]

Morning on the steppe—
the air is crisp and moist with dew.
The sun has yet to fully rise, but a soft golden hue brushes the horizon.

Young Temujin stands alone on the endless grassland.
Beneath his feet, damp earth and wet grass.
Morning dew glistens on each blade, and the cold wind, carrying the scent of the plains,
tosses his short black hair with abandon.

In the distance, his father’s silhouette fades slowly into the horizon—
a figure ever out of reach, always vanishing into the faraway.
Temujin stands tall, his back to the rising sun.
The storm has passed.
The vastness and solitude of the steppe peak at this very moment.
There are no words, no movement—only his father's voice echoing across the expanse:
**"You must learn endurance and resilience, for the world will never be gentle to you."**

Young Temujin lowers his head, eyes filled with confusion and pain.
His small hands clutch tightly at his tunic,
as if only that could anchor him against the hollow ache growing within.
He cannot yet understand his father’s cold resolve—
he only knows that disappearing figure feels like a distance that can never be crossed.

**“Why is he always so distant?”**
Temujin silently asks himself.

Far across the field, on another patch of open grassland,
Bekhter and several children are playing.
Bekhter, two years older, is tall and carries a mischievous smile—
a child of the steppe, untamed and carefree.

He runs wildly with his younger siblings, and even children from the Mönlik clan.
Their laughter fills the open space, pure and joyful,
a picture of childhood untouched by weight or worry.

Temujin watches them in silence, a quiet sting in his heart.
That fearless freedom of youth feels like a world separated from him by a veil he cannot pass.
He knows—it is not his world.
He cannot live like Bekhter, shedding all restraint to enjoy the grassland’s ease.
He already carries his father’s expectations, his teachings,
and the heavy burden of a kingdom not yet born.

In the wind that brushes the steppe,
he feels a loneliness deeper than he has ever known.

His father’s silhouette is long gone,
but Temujin remains, facing the vast expanse,
listening to the whispering sound of wind through grass.

**“One day,”** he tells himself, **“you too must walk this land alone, just as Father did.”**



[EXT. Frozen Heilongjiang River · Sunset]

The dying light of the setting sun spills across the snow-covered surface of the Heilongjiang River.
The frozen expanse glistens like a colossal mirror, reflecting a streak of orange-red at the horizon—
as if the last warmth of the world has gathered in this final glow.

The northern wind kicks up powdered snow.
Temujin lifts his gaze, eyes fixed on the boundless sheet of ice before him.
His stare is deep, as though piercing through the flood of time,
returning to a distant, long-buried past.

The cracks in the ice and scattered snow resemble the fractures within his heart,
etched by the scars of memory.
The wind and snow have numbed his shoulders, scraping at his outer robe with biting cold—
yet Temujin does not stop.
Still astride his aging horse, he remains composed and resolute, just as in days gone by.
But he knows—he is no longer that naïve boy,
no longer the child who once looked up to his father with pure admiration.

Time has granted him strength and duty,
but it has also burdened him with an unbearable solitude and pain.

He draws a deep breath, as if inhaling the cold essence of the Heilongjiang.
There is a heaviness in the air—
a winter stillness, laced with a chilling clarity unique to the season.

His gaze shifts from the ice to the horizon.
The ambitions of youth, the dreams once held close—
they all converge upon this vast land,
weaving into a fate he can no longer escape.

**"Everything is the result of my own choices."**

The thought flashes through Temujin’s mind.
He remembers the blood and fire of countless battles,
the long years endured in the biting wind.
Each war, every decision—made at the crossroads of destiny.
And all of them, without exception, have led to this:
the man he has become—
a weathered emperor, worn by the ages.

He once naively believed that ascending the throne meant gaining everything.
But the brutality of reality taught him otherwise:
**the loneliness of a king is something no one can ever truly comprehend.**

The ice he crosses is not just frozen water,
but the long, bitter stretch of history itself—
a mirror to his every decision and regret.
All the past glory, all the once-vivid dreams,
now seem so fragile, so insignificant beneath the weight of snow and silence.

**"My father’s silhouette still lingers in my heart."**

Temujin sighs inwardly.
He remembers the moment his father left, that departing figure forever etched into his memory—
a symbol not just of loss, but of inheritance.
A symbol of fate's solitude, and the crushing weight of duty.

He once wondered, many times,
if he could live freely like Bekhter,
whether he might have chosen a different path.

But now, he knows—
such thoughts no longer matter.
Temujin no longer yearns to change what has been.
All he wishes now is to guard this land,
to hold onto this icy earth that has broken his heart again and again.
Because this is the fate he chose.
The destiny he cannot escape.

The sound of hooves on ice grows faint,
gradually swallowed by the falling dusk.
As if even Temujin himself is slipping away—
from the unbearable past,
from all that once was.

He lowers his head, eyes fixed on the reins gripped tightly in his hands.
It is the only thing he can still control.
Everything else…
has already vanished down the river of time.



[FLASHBACK · The Father’s Bride Capture (Hö’elün)]

The scorching sun blazed down upon the Mongolian steppe.
Bodun Yesügei galloped at full speed,
seizing the young Hö’elün by force.

The wind over the grasslands howled, mingling with the pounding of hooves.
Behind them, the people of the Merkit tribe gave furious chase—
but no matter how hard they rode,
they could not alter the course of fate.

On Yesügei’s face flickered a complex expression—
part triumph, part guarded uncertainty.
He did not laugh, nor shout.
He only turned back in silence,
gazing at the tribe fading in the distance,
as if calculating something deeper, unspoken.

As the hoofbeats faded behind him,
Yesügei returned to the main tent of the camp.
Dismounting swiftly,
he dropped to his knees before the young Hö’elün and offered his apology.

At that moment,
the remorse in his voice struck a raw nerve of shame within him—
and alongside it, revealed a yearning:
a thirst for knowledge,
a hunger not just for conquest,
but for understanding.

With his head bowed low, he said with sincerity:
“Let the fall of the Turkic Empire be my warning—
teach me how to defeat the Jin.”

Narration · Older Temüjin’s voice:
“In that moment, it was not love that moved him.
He was probing—probing the steppe itself,
probing the nation hidden behind her eyes.”




[NIGHT · INSIDE THE TENT · MOTHER AND SON ALONE]**

**Temüjin:**
*“Mother, why have you never spoken of your people?”*

**Hö’elün** *(gazing up at the stars):*
*“Because they lost. Lost to their own delusions of righteousness.”*

**Temüjin:**
*“But didn’t you teach me compassion?”*

**Hö’elün** *(soft, almost amused):*
*“Compassion is for your own people—never for your enemies.
‘Civilization’ is the victor’s excuse written for the defeated.”*

**Temüjin:**
*“Then why did you let Father take you?”*

**Hö’elün** *(her gaze turns sharp as a blade):*
*“I wasn’t taken. I was chosen.
What your father saw wasn’t a woman—
it was the unfinished empire in my mind.”*




[DRAMATIC SCENE · INTERIOR · NIGHT · HÖ’ELÜN’S TENT]**

*Background: Night. A snowstorm lashes the camp. Hö’elün has summoned Temüjin and Börte. Inside the dimly lit tent, an oil lamp flickers. She is draped in an old Turkic cloak, her gaze calm and cold as the frozen steppe. On the ground lies the skeleton of a golden eagle—symbol of the fallen Turkic Empire.*

**Hö’elün** *(slowly)*
*The day your father took me, he didn’t take *me*.
He took *that*.*

*(She points to the golden eagle’s skeleton.)*

*He didn’t understand. But I did.
In an empire, choosing who rules, and choosing who tends the fire—
these are not the same thing.*

**Temüjin** *(confused)*
*Mother… then why did you teach only me, not Qachar or Bekter?*

**Hö’elün** *(calmly)*
*Because they deserve an easier life.
They weren’t meant to carry what you must bear.*

*A khan is not a man. He’s a program.
What you’re inheriting—
is a logic of empire, passed down in pieces:
from the Turks, to the Xianbei, to the Shiwei,
broken, revived, then scattered again in your grandfather’s hands.*

*Their blood is too thin. Their hearts too soft.
You’re the only line I could gamble on.*

**Börte** *(softly)*
*Then… our children?
Will you choose only one too?*

**Hö’elün** *(smiling faintly)*
*From your children, I’ll also choose only one.
The rest—like flames on a stove—
keep them warm, but never let them leap.*

*Remember—
not everyone deserves to know how a khan is made.
And fewer still,
deserve to carry the name.*





**Temüjin** *(with slight unease)*
*Then… who will you choose?
Who do you want me to pass it on to?*

**Hö’elün** *(gazing into the fire)*
*The firstborn. Always the firstborn.*
*In the house of khans, we don’t raise living Buddhas,
we don’t crown child-kings,
and we don’t believe in luck.*
*We believe in order.*

*Firstborn succession is the instinct of the steppe—*
*but I sealed it with a curse.*

*(She draws a bone token from her robe, engraved with old Turkic script, and hands it to Temüjin.)*

**“He who makes kings must never become one.
He who keeps the fire must never claim the throne.”**

**Börte** *(bowing deeply)*
*I will remember this.*

**Hö’elün** *(to Temüjin)*
*Right now, you're just the lead wolf of the pack—
not yet the “Wolf God.”*

*To become King of Kings,
you must learn to let others *make* the king—
and be only the one who finally *receives* the crown.*

*By the time your son’s son is grown,
the Golden Horde will split.
Your bloodline will be called “Makers of Kings.”
But never forget—*

*True kingship passes only through the fire in the blood—
not through wit, not through cunning, not through love.*

*Love…
is for the children who sleep by the hearth.*

*(The wind howls outside, like a beast unleashed.)*

**Hö’elün** *(whispering like an incantation)*
*"The fire must not scatter.
The blood must not mix.
The kings… must never be many."*





**Dramatic Scene · Interior · Late Night · Women’s Whisper in the Tent**

**Background:**
Temüjin has left the main tent, and the snowstorm persists. Hoelun keeps Borte from leaving. Inside the tent, the firelight dims, as if only their breaths and the echoes of the snow remain.

**Hoelun** (sitting on the couch, caressing her aged hands)
Do you think I keep you here because you are virtuous and obedient?

**Borte** (looking down)
I… dare not presume.

**Hoelun** (smiling)
Don’t be afraid. In this family, the one thing I dislike the most is a “submissive woman.”
I chose you because you are like me. Not like other women. Not like other concubines.

**Borte** (her gaze shifts slightly)
But I am your son's woman.

**Hoelun**
And I am your father-in-law’s woman. When he died, I knew he had failed.

He took me because I understood the failure of the Turkic Empire. He didn’t want to be taken away, he wanted to take away the shadow of that empire.

The tent you’re in now isn’t a place for women; it’s the furnace where the dynasty is forged.

**Borte** (slowly sits down)
Then… what do you wish to teach me?

**Hoelun** (her gaze piercing through the firelight)
I want you to remember three things:

One, “A queen is not a woman; she is a seed filter.”
You must filter out weakness, mixed blood, and emotional descendants. A dynasty cannot thrive on “love” but must rely on selection.

Two, “The children of concubines are not your enemies; they are your weapons.”
You must treat them kindly, but never let them be your equal. Your mercy should be their chains. Let their children always look up to the back of your son.

Three, “You must choose your grandson.”
I chose you. In the future, you must choose someone who can inherit the flame—not the smartest, not the strongest, but the one who can make other flames submit to him.

**Borte** (in a low voice)
Then… will you tell me how to choose?

**Hoelun** (standing up, walking toward the fire)
You will know, just as I knew when I first saw you, that you would be the second “Mother Queen” of this house.

The empire cannot have too many Mother Queens. Too many, and it becomes a counterfeit. There can only be one—everyone else, give her fire, and leave once it’s lit.

**Borte** (on the verge of tears)
What about my daughters? Can I keep them?

**Hoelun** (turning back, gently)
Keep them. But don’t let them think they can change the rules. They are the furnace, not the sword makers. You are the sword maker.

(Outside, the snow stops, and the sky begins to brighten.)

**Hoelun** (whispering, almost to herself)
The Mongol Empire will be born from your belly.

But you are not the queen, you are the “refiner”—refining fire, refining kings, refining a seed that will one day be honored as “the king of all kings.”





**Interior · Felt Tent, Late Night · The Firelight Flickers**

**Hoelun** (softly, staring at the flames):
"You must remember, the empire is not built through conquest, but by my passing the secret to him... one person, one generation."

**Borte** (softly):
"Mother, but those children who do not inherit the secret, their hearts are bound to feel resentment. They were born on this same steppe, and they too wish to become 'the king of all kings.'"

**Hoelun** (closing her eyes, a moment of silence):
"I know their suffering... But once they conspire with one another, seeking the throne, the empire will be doomed."

**Borte**:
"Because they do not understand where that line lies, they do not understand why we pass the secret to only one?"

**Hoelun** (opening her eyes, her gaze sharp as a knife):
"Exactly. That is why they will tear the system apart. They will foolishly try to turn the 'unspoken rules' into something anyone can claim, yet they do not realize—it is a fire that cannot be named. Once it is revealed, it loses all meaning."

**Borte** (lowering her head):
"Then what can we do?"

**Hoelun** (calmly):
"We can only choose someone who can truly protect the flame, just as I chose your father, just as I later chose him. Then, we must protect the night for him... until the dawn."





**Interior · Golden Tent · Cold Night Unfolding · The Wind Howls Like a Roar**

The firelight flickers slightly, and Temüjin has already left. Jebe will begin his westward journey, and the Mother of the Steppe, Hoelun, sits alone with her daughter-in-law, Borte, in the felt tent. The flames before them seem to devour the silence of the entire night.

**Hoelun** (whispering):
"Do you know why this secret was never passed to my own daughters? They are just as intelligent, just as much of my blood."

**Borte** (softly):
"Because they would not bear the silence. Only those willing to remain silent can guard the truth that cannot be revealed."

**Hoelun** (nodding slowly):
"Temüjin received the inheritance from me. He thought it was the mark of power. But only you know—it is the price of order."

**Borte** (looking up):
"Jebe still does not understand. He thinks he is walking toward the throne."

**Hoelun** (her gaze sharp):
"Jebe seeks to become the 'kingmaker.' The position of 'the king of all kings' will always belong to your great khan family, not to his descendants."

**Borte** (silent for a moment):
"I will teach him. I will teach him how to make a king his son, not to be the father of a king."

**Hoelun** (taking a deep breath):
"You have taken on my silence. From now on, this secret no longer belongs to me. This empire—from this day forward—will no longer belong solely to Temüjin."

She slowly takes an ancient totem, embedded with jade, from around her neck and places it in Borte’s palm.

**Hoelun** (with determination):
"You are the second 'kingmaker.' Jebe’s westward journey is the march of fire. And you, you are the night watchman in the ashes."

The firelight illuminates Borte’s face. She bows her head in respect, her tone low but resolute:

**Borte**:
"I will wait for that night, and then choose the next one who can remain silent."





**On the Banks of the Heilong River · Nightfall Approaches, Temüjin and Borte Stand Together on the Frozen Riverbank**

The wind sweeps snowflakes across the frozen steppe, the river’s surface glistening with an eerie light. Temüjin gazes at the distant, quietly flowing Black Water, his tone deep:

**Temüjin:** "Do you know this river—once called 'Black Water'—was where my ancestors held their alliance. After the Ban Junni oath was sworn, that river should carry this name."

**Borte** lightly adjusts her fox fur cloak, her brows furrowed slightly: "Why change it?"

Temüjin does not answer, slowly drawing his dagger and carving two words onto the ice—Black Water.

**Temüjin:** "'Ban Junni' no longer represents a tribal pact, but the fracture of the old world order. From that day, I name that river Black Water, so that all under heaven may know—that Temüjin stands here to forge a new alliance, not for the steppe, not for the tribes, but to fight for the order of the world."

He turns to face Borte, his eyes burning like flames:

**Temüjin:** "I want those ancient sages, long hidden from the world, to come forth—the Moists. They are still here, though unseen."

Borte remains silent for a moment before speaking: "So, you are sending a summons to the Moists through the symbols of the ancients?"

Temüjin gives a slight nod: "Exactly. 'Black Water' is not just water, it is a name. The Moists have always recognized meaning through names, and acted on the intent behind them. Those who understand the meaning will come."

Borte whispers: "'Black Water' has always been a name used for secretive places, hidden paths of soldiers... Are you trying to awaken those who live in the shadows?"

Temüjin's gaze becomes distant, as though peering through both history and the future:

**Temüjin:** "Black Water is never just a place name. Whenever power stirs in the shadows, and the chessboard shifts, it will appear. It is a metaphor for hidden will, secret games, and unrecorded history. Naming the river 'Black Water' is sending a signal—
The game has begun, and the situation will change.
Those who understand, will come."

The snow night is silent. Only the river flows quietly, as though whispering a response to the ancient call.





**Memory · Betrothal at Eight**

(The early winter on the steppe, with the first frost settling, the sunlight sharp like a blade. A felt yurt stands in the cold wind, with banners hanging silently, and several tribal leaders are lined up outside. The wedding ceremony of the Hongjila tribe today marks an alliance of great significance.)

Temüjin arrived with his father Yesügei from a distant land. He was eight years old, small and frail, but stood straight in front of the horse, his gaze filled with a determination far beyond his years.

His mother, Hoelun, did not accompany them. As the daughter of the Bösiqur Hongjila clan, she was now Yesügei's primary wife and the matron of the Qiyan tribe, and must stay to guard the family's yurt. After many years of marriage, her husband had brought their son back to her homeland to negotiate the betrothal, while she stayed behind on the steppe, watching the winds and weeping in silence.

Yesügei, draped in a fox fur, had a calm expression. He sat on his horse, silently surveying the guests. His eyes eventually rested on an elder of the same Hongjila nobility—Borte's father, De Xuechan, the head of the Huo'ai clan.

De Xuechan stepped out of the yurt, leading his daughter. Borte was only nine years old, neatly dressed, her eyes free of tears, but her expression was clear and calm like water. She saw Temüjin, and without shyness, gave a slight nod, as if she already knew him.

Yesügei dismounted and, taking his son’s hand, walked toward De Xuechan. The two men exchanged a solemn glance, but said no words, as if the wind on the steppe had already spoken their plans.

Slowly, Yesügei raised Temüjin’s right hand and placed it into De Xuechan’s palm. His movements were steady, the gesture solemn, like an oath.

Outside the yurt, several tribal leaders exchanged glances and whispered:

“The Hongjila and Qiyan bloodlines were already connected.”
“Yet Yesügei still seeks the betrothal… What is his intent?”
“It’s not a daughter-in-law, it’s an alliance.”

Borte quietly watched the small boy. Though he said nothing, he stood tall, his eyes vigilantly scanning the crowd. He did not seem to be here for a wedding, but like a young warrior.

De Xuechan spoke in a deep voice: “I accept this betrothal, and this alliance.”

Yesügei’s eyes were sharp, his tone calm but resolute:

“You will not regret it.”
“He will walk beyond the steppe in the future.”

The crowd fell silent. Some bowed their heads, others furrowed their brows, but no one spoke against him.

(After the ceremony, Temüjin turned back to glance at the girl with the black hair cascading over her shoulders inside the yurt. He did not know that she would become his companion in fate. But he remembered that moment—she stood in the wind, like him, silent and unafraid.)

(Narration · The inner whisper of his mother, Hoelun)

“He is making an alliance for me.”
“What he seeks is not a daughter-in-law, but a new steppe.”





**Memory · The Death of a Father**

(Night. The wind howls like ghostly whispers. The camp is silent, save for a lone lamp casting the shadow of Ba’atur Yesügei’s back. He sits alone in the yurt, the liquor in his copper cup trembling slightly, firelight casting heavy shadows.)

This cup of wine—was both a gift and a warning.

Today, he had just returned from a minor victory abroad, passing through a feast hosted by the Tatars. He knew that wine had come with unspoken intent, yet still accepted it without a frown.

Yesügei had always been a man who stared fate in the face. Where the steppe wind could not reach, his gaze had already swept across; before men voiced their intentions, he had already heard them loud and clear.

He drank the wine to the last drop, his face showing not a trace of emotion. Yet now, deep into the night, the intoxication surged back, and cold sweat began to bead on his forehead.

Suddenly, his expression twisted, as though pierced in the heart by an invisible arrow. Clutching his chest, he convulsed violently. The cup fell with a *clang*, rolling into a dark corner of the yurt.

The spilled liquor soaked into the carpet, red and black mixing, slowly spreading—like a pool of blood, congealing.

He tried to shout, but no sound came.

He remembered the look in his son’s eyes during the betrothal ceremony—the murmurs of the tribal chiefs—and that icy, unspoken thread of alliance between the Mongols and the Hongjila, as sharp as winter frost.

(Outside, footsteps suddenly broke out—chaotic, panicked.)

Hoelun’s cry tore through the cold night. She stumbled into the yurt and saw him collapsed in a pool of wine and blood.

“Ba’atur! What’s happened to you?!”
“Someone—help, quickly!”

She fell to her knees beside him, her tears not yet fallen, her voice already breaking.

Yesügei struggled to open his eyes, as if trying to speak—but his gaze passed over Hoelun, fixing on the ceiling of the yurt, as though in that void, he saw the outline of the entire steppe.

Then, his eyes lost focus, sinking into the darkness of night.

**(Narration · The whisper of an era)**

*A cup of poisoned wine, in exchange for peace on the steppe.*
*The Jin Empire, master of the steppe, sensed the shifting winds.*
*The union of the Mongols and the Hongjila was a silent rebellion.*
*They were not merely marrying—they were forging an alliance.*
*It was a challenge to hegemony.*
*So the wine carried both an order, and a warning born of fear.*

**(Closing scene)**
(The fire burns low. Outside the yurt, the wind stirs the curtain. Temüjin is carried over, standing at the threshold. He does not enter—only stares at his father's body. He is too young, yet he has begun to understand: death is not merely an end, but the beginning of inheritance.)




**Memory · Exile and Scattering**

(Dawn has not yet broken, but the Qiyan tribe’s encampment has already begun to shift in silence. No drums, no farewells—only the quiet dismantling of tents, the driving of horses, the gradual pulling away.)

Temüjin stands atop a grassy hill. Behind him, a battered felt yurt. His mother, Hoelun, cradles the youngest sibling, her face weary yet unyielding. The other brothers and sisters sit around a heap of cold ashes, silent hunger in their eyes.

Just days ago, their father, Yesügei, died suddenly—and with his death, the chill of the steppe grew sharper.

There were no open accusations, no written decree of exile. Just one morning, clansmen began avoiding their gaze, stopped bringing water, withheld the grain rations, and gradually moved their yurt to the outer fringe of the camp—and then beyond.

No one came to visit anymore. No one said Temüjin’s name.

It was the will of the Jin Empire—unspoken, yet clearly understood by the people of the steppe: *Do not provoke a greater power.*

(The wind sweeps the hill like a blade. A few children who once laughed by Temüjin’s saddle now pass by with heads down, avoiding his eyes, not daring to stop.)

Hoelun clutches the swaddled infant tightly. She leans down and whispers to her son:

> “We are torn flesh, but the bones remain. Do not bow your head.”
> “Remember the backs that turned away—and remember our name.”

They moved deeper into the valley, where the tents were so thin the wind cut right through. At night, they shivered with cold. No meat, no milk—sometimes they scraped bark, or dug up bugs. Hoelun led the children to gather wild herbs, dig mouse holes—like a cornered beast, protecting the last spark of warmth.

Temüjin learned to tie snare lines for wild horses, and also how to hunt on an empty stomach. He no longer cried, rarely spoke—only stared, each time the wind rose, toward the direction where his people had vanished.

He came to understand: *Indifference is harder than snow.*

**(Narration · It belongs to no one, only to the wind)**

> “They feared us.”
> “Just as the Jin Empire fears a wolf not yet grown.”
> “The wolf has not bitten, but its teeth are already showing.”
> “And the steppe—it never forgets the direction of the teeth.”

**(Closing scene)**
(Night. Temüjin sits huddled with his mother by the fire. The stars above are cold and sunken. In his hand, he gently holds an arrowhead carved from rabbit bone—his own work. He knows:
He cannot rely on his mother forever.
And he cannot keep waiting for spring.)





**Memory · Holding a Family Together in Adversity**

Spring finally came to the steppe. The ice and snow melted into mud, and the children’s feet splashed through it with a wet, sucking sound. The sunlight had yet to bring warmth to their hearts, but at least, the wind outside the tent no longer flayed the skin raw.

Temüjin and Khasar stood by a still half-frozen stream, using whittled fish spears to catch spring crucian carp—one of the first fish to awaken after the brutal winter. Temüjin was swift and steady. Khasar, clumsy but full of innocent energy, laughed every time he lunged and missed. It was a battle between two boys, and also a search for hope between two brothers.

Across the riverbank, Begter stood with his arms crossed. He said nothing, only watched coldly. He could have joined them—helped catch fish, tie them up, carry them back. But he just stood there, as if waiting for something.

Later, Temüjin returned to camp, each step sinking into the muddy ground, fish packed into a coarse animal-hide sack. His mother, Hoelun, was already boiling water over the fire—root broth scraped from dry bark. It was bitter and bland, but fooled the belly into thinking it had eaten.

The children gathered around her. Just as Temüjin reached to share the fish, Begter suddenly grabbed the sack and walked off. In that moment, the firelight caught half his face—young, yet cold and sharp.

> “We caught those fish!” Khasar shouted, leaping to his feet.

Begter didn’t look back. He replied coolly:

> “You’re the younger brother. You obey your father.”

The air froze.

No one laughed. Hoelun’s hand paused mid-motion. The wooden bowl of root broth trembled slightly in her grasp.

Begter’s voice was calm, but that single word—“father”—dragged everyone back to a bitter and absurd reality: *levirate marriage*.

He was reminding Temüjin: Soon, Begter’s mother, Sochigel, would become Temüjin’s wife. And Begter—two years older than Temüjin—would have to start calling him *Ata*, father.

Even Khasar went quiet. Young as he was, he could sense the thick bitterness and shame in the air.

**(Narration)**

> “He is my younger brother, and also my father.
> It is not madness. It is custom.”

Begter said nothing more. He tossed the fish in front of Sochigel—part offering, part act of revenge. His gaze toward his mother was tangled with pain—not hatred, but despair. He was punishing her. And punishing the fate that had shamed them all.

Sochigel silently picked up the fish and turned into the tent without a word. Hoelun watched her go, a flicker of tenderness and pity in her eyes—but she could say nothing to stop it.

The firelight lit up the faces of the four children. Hoelun gently passed the broth to Belgutei, Begter’s little brother. He was still too young, his eyes blank with confusion. He didn’t know why his brother was angry, or what it all meant.

Temüjin stared at the muddy ground, his teeth clenched. He had never felt such humiliation. He did not want to be anyone’s *Ata*, nor to play a part in this grim comedy of the steppe.

Though spring had come, in this family, the ice had never truly melted.





[Memory · Slaughter and Reckoning]**

The night dyed the steppe iron-blue. Wind swept in from the highlands—cold as a blade, carrying silence, hatred, and the absurdity of fate.

Temujin and Khasar returned from fishing once more, a basket glinting with silver fish—their most abundant catch in days. Their faces bore a rare lightness. But before they could reach the camp, Bekter appeared in the middle of the path, his face shadowed darker than the night.

“Give it to me,” he said, hand extended, leaving no room for refusal.

Temujin stepped forward. “We caught these.”

Bekter sneered. “I am your father.” His voice wasn’t loud, but to Temujin, it exploded in his ears.

That line again.

Temujin froze. Khasar trembled slightly. They both understood—this was no jest, but the bones and tongues warped by the *levirate*, a custom too deeply embedded. Even a child must bow to its twisted logic. Bekter could not accept that his younger half-brother, Temujin, would become his “father.”

Bekter snatched the fish and turned away. His footsteps landed like stones on Temujin’s heart.

In that moment, rage found its release.

Temujin looked silently at Khasar—a wordless call. They needed no speech. Raised together against hunger and wind, their bond was as sharp and sure as an arrowhead.

That night, the moon hung high, casting its pale eye over the steppe. Two children hid behind dry brush, cloaked in wolfskin. Temujin’s fingers blanched as he drew the bowstring taut.

Bekter sat by the river, eating fish, unsuspecting. He hadn’t even turned his head when the first arrow shot from the dark, striking him in the back. He staggered up—another arrow pierced his throat.

He collapsed, his cheek pressed against mud not yet dry. His blood flowed into the river, mingling with the water where they once fished together.

This was no duel. It was a rebellion—young wolves snapping their first chains, a child's answer to a fate too cruel.

When Hoelun arrived, the boys were silent. They didn’t flee. They didn’t cry. Their eyes, cold and heavy, seemed carved from wind-worn stone.

Hoelun looked at the corpse, then at the bow in Temujin’s hand. She asked no questions. She crouched beside him, gently touched his shoulder, and said, low and steady, “From now on, Belgutei is your true brother. Care for him as you do Khasar.”

Temujin said nothing. But he nodded, hard. His eyes told her he understood—and accepted.

That night, Sukhagulun did not weep. She simply carried her son's body into the tent, washed and stitched him, wrapped him in the finest hide. Her hands trembled, but not a word of blame passed her lips.

She, too, knew: the fault was not Temujin’s.

**(Voiceover)**
*"She knew—that arrow did not just kill her son. It pierced through the absurdity of the steppe."*

Her fury was not for Temujin, but for the man who had written the levirate into their flesh—Yesugei Ba’atur. The man who claimed her youth, doomed her son to ethical collapse, and forced him to die in shame.

From that moment, Sukhagulun and Hoelun—though not sisters by blood—became co-conspirators in fate, bonded by tragedy.

They no longer fled, nor did they dream. They buried their sorrow beneath a felt rug, and waited—for a new era that would belong to women and children.






[Memory · Female Awakening under Ethical Reformation]**

The sun rose, illuminating the bloodstains and silence.

Bekter’s death struck the shattered family like a heavy stone dropped into a still pond, sending ripples far and wide. His body was buried by the river bend—his favorite fishing spot. Hö’elün chose the place, with Sorghaghchtani's quiet consent.

No wailing, no tribesmen, only two women and the wind over the steppe.

That night, Sorghaghchtani walked alone into Temujin’s tent. She came not to accuse, nor to beg. She simply sat by the fire, staring into the eyes of the boy who had killed her son.

Her voice was slow, as if speaking to fate itself:

“I know you will be the Great Khan. But before that, I want you to be a man who respects women.”

Temujin flinched but did not look at her.

“I’m not here to be your woman,” she continued. “I’m here to be the beginning of your world of women.”

That sentence, like a rare warm southern wind, blew into Temujin’s iron-hardened heart. He said nothing, only leaned forward and stoked the fire.

From that moment, Sorghaghchtani no longer remained silent. She began taking part in the family’s daily work, teaching Temujin how to care for his brothers, listen to his mother, and respect the feelings of every woman around him. She influenced him not through orders, but through warmth and understanding—completely different from Hö’elün.

One night, she sat shoulder-to-shoulder with Hö’elün at the felt tent’s entrance, gazing up at the starry sky.

“We must not let the next generation grow up in the chaos we endured,” she said softly.

Hö’elün paused, then nodded. “Then let it begin with us.”

Thus, a new family model quietly emerged. After marrying Börte, Temujin chose to live in one tent with both her and Sorghaghchtani. This was not a traditional polygamous household, but a transitional ethic forged in a fractured era—a collaborative attempt initiated by the women themselves.

They shared a single woolen blanket, raised children together, made joint decisions about food, and lay awake at night worrying about raids by the Turks.

Of course, such harmony was also fragile—years later, both Sorghaghchtani and Börte would be captured together, and this “restructured order” would again be torn apart by outside forces.

That night, Hö’elün found Temujin.

Firelight danced across the lines of exhaustion on her face, but her voice remained strong:

“You hate him, because deep down you knew he hated himself. He didn’t bring your brother fishing—he went alone to provoke you. He wanted to die. He used death to escape the shame and chaos that the levirate system had forced upon him.”

Temujin clenched his fists, knuckles white.

“You thought he came to steal the fish. But he came seeking death. He handed you all the chaos, and forced you to carry the burden of building a clean world.”

The fire crackled. The tent fell into silence. Only the wind crept in through the seams.

Temujin bowed his head, wordless for a long time. At last, he understood: some hatred is merely the venom spewed by a fate collapsing in on itself—not the intention of men.

> *(Narration)*
> “The father is dead. But the system lives on.”
> “In the ruins, women rebuild the order—no longer waiting for men to tell them how to live.”
> “Bekter is dead. He is no longer my brother in name and elder in truth. I am no longer his father.”






[Börte: The Girl Who Walked into the Wolf Pack]**

**Background:**
After Yesügei’s death, the marriage pact was as good as void. Töregene Huo’ai, Börte’s father, knew well: for his daughter to uphold the engagement was to gamble on a boy in exile—and possibly bring the wrath of the Jurchens down upon the Khongirad clan.

**Father-Daughter Dialogue:**

**Töregene:**
“My daughter, the winds of the steppe have shifted. Yesügei is dead. The Jin Empire wishes us to form an alliance through marriage with the Merkit. If you do not wish to honor the old pact, I will bear it for you.”

**Börte** (only 9 years old) paused in silence, then raised her head with firm resolve:
“I am marrying *him*—not his tribe, not his wealth. Yesügei may be dead, but his son lives. He is a wolf, not a dog. And I will marry the wolf.”

**Political Stand Declared:**
The Khongirad clan rejected the Jin Empire’s pressure to remarry Börte and publicly announced:
“Börte is already betrothed. She cannot be wed again.”

From age nine to sixteen, Börte remained in the Khongirad tribe, known to all as a maiden promised in marriage. All other suitors were courteously declined.

She was a symbol of alliance—and a spark of defiance against the fate imposed by the Jurchens.

**Narration:**
“She was no sacrifice. She was the will of strategy.
She knew she would step into a tattered tent,
to lie beneath a woolen blanket with a boy who had killed his own brother—
but she never flinched.
She did not marry for the steppe’s glory.
She married for her own choice.”





Reminiscence · Three Years in the Wind · Newly Wed**
— In memory of the grassland years, 1177 to 1180

The dusk was trimmed by wind, the night embraced its first fire.
The maiden’s hair had yet to rise in the knot of queens;
She was still Börte, who walked from the spring grass that year,
Eyes clear as riverlight, untouched by sorrow.

Temüjin had not yet worn armor like a mountain—
He shed his father’s name but kept a curved blade in his heart.
That year, he learned to plow, to ride, to stitch what tore,
But more than all, he learned to love someone.

Söchigel brewed milk tea in silence,
Her gaze often followed Börte’s quiet steps.
Mother and wife, mirror and stream—
Temüjin dared not look too long.

Hoelun had not remarried,
Still clutching her ancestors’ bell in the oryx-hide tent.
Her shoulders bore the truth of the world before time could speak,
Yet still too slow to lay down her son’s fate.

Khasar and Belgutei,
Took turns beneath the stars telling tales of game and dreams.
At times, they asked, “When will our sister bear a child?”
Börte smiled gently, her eyes revealing nothing.

Spring came and went, three years passed like three riders in wind—
The hills rang with herdsmen’s songs,
The livestock grew strong like wild vows.
And at last, behind the tent, a cradle stirred—
The firstborn of Temüjin and Börte: *Jochi Beki*,
A princess born to dawn.
Joy bloomed in the home,
And in the grassland’s chorus,
A new verse rode the wind.





**Reminiscence · The Storm of Abduction · Collapse by Force**

**\[External Events]**

In the early spring of 1180, the steppe had yet to thaw; wind and snow still carried the bite of blades.
Only a month into their marriage, Temüjin’s fragile new household was torn apart for the first time.

A united force of the Three Clans of the Merkit—
*Toqto’a Beki* of the Uduyid, *Dayir Usun* of the Uwas, and *Qa’atay Darimalai* of the Qa’at—
rode under Jin command with three hundred horsemen in a dawn assault.
Temüjin’s camp was breached before sunrise.

Temüjin fought his way out. His mother Hoelun took an arrow in her left arm.
His younger sister fled into the woods.
The young Temüjin, with Khasar and his siblings, hid deep within an icy crevice in the river gorge.

Outside, fire engulfed the tents.
Börte and Söchigel were seized in the chaos.

The Merkits divided their captives—
Börte was given to *Chilger Bökh*,
Söchigel to *Qa’atay Darimalai*.

**\[Dialogue]**

As they were taken through wind and snow, heads bare,
Söchigel’s eyes were blank, her hair tangled in frost.
Börte clenched her jaw, but her spine remained straight.

She whispered,
“You are both my husband’s mother and his wife. That makes you my mother, too.
If I ever escape—I'll protect you.”

Söchigel turned to her, tears still staining her face. She whispered back,
“When I was young, I swore to protect Hoelun.
But sometimes, child… we only have each other.”

Two women, stripped of their sons and husbands,
clutched hands in the cold ruin—seeking warmth in each other.

**\[Emotional Core]**

In that moment, Börte understood:
Women of the steppe do not survive by men, but by one another.
And Söchigel knew:
She was no longer Hoelun’s only heir—
Börte would be the next to reshape the rules of the world.

**\[Narration]**

Mother and wife walked into the night, side by side.
The men had escaped—not in shame, but in fate.
And that boy, for the first time,
understood what it meant—to be powerless to protect.





**Reminiscence · Journey for Aid · A Weak Man’s Strategy**

**\[Timeline]**

On the third day after the abduction,
Temüjin was still counting the survivors of his scattered kin.
Hoelun stood in the cutting wind,
her arm bound in bloodied cloth, leaning on a broken spear as a crutch.

Her words etched like blades into Temüjin’s soul:

> “When Yesügei of the Borjigin took me long ago,
> Nekhchir and Chiledu never came.
> He never wondered—was I still alive?
>
> But you are my son.
> I will not let you become like the man I once called husband,
> who did not even try.”
>
> “Tell the entire steppe: you are not the same.
> Bring your women home—no matter how long it takes.”

Temüjin said nothing.
He knelt at her feet and bowed thrice to the frozen earth.

---

**\[Action Unfolds]**

With a handful of loyal guards,
he rode, dusty and grim, to the camp of his blood-brother—Jamukha.

Inside his great tent, Jamukha listened silently.
Once, they had sworn brotherhood in blood.
Now, Jamukha ruled as khan of his own tribe.

Jamukha said,

> “You come with barely fifty riders. I have a thousand.
> What gives you the right to command me?”

Temüjin rose slowly, voice low but unshaken:

> “Shame. The kind that cannot be ignored.”

Jamukha laughed aloud, then narrowed his eyes:

> “You’d have me wage war for shame?”

Temüjin answered:

> “Not for revenge over women.
> For this: to make sure every soul on this steppe knows—
> Our women are not for the taking.”

He paused. Met Jamukha’s gaze.

> “You’re not helping *me*—you’re helping *us*.
> So that when we stand at the heart of the steppe one day,
> We can still say: *We are kings who know where the line is drawn.*”

Jamukha was silent a long while.
Then he sighed.

> “This is not a war.
> It is a man’s declaration to the world.”

---

**\[Emotional Core]**

Temüjin knew: he was not the stronger man.
But he could wield *shame* and *honor* as weapons—
to press the strong into motion.
From weakness, he pulled the lever of principle.

Jamukha realized:
his sworn brother was no longer a boy who lived by oath—
but a man who could rally warriors with nothing but words and will.

---

**\[Narration]**

In the language of men, revenge speaks loud—
But it is only after losing a woman
that one learns the true weight of *dignity*.

That year, the steppe had no laws—
only the sound of skin tearing in public shame.

But through dignity,
he summoned an army,
and carved the steppe’s first unbreakable rule.





**Reminiscence · Silence Gestates · Life in Captivity**

**\[Timeline]**
Nine months dragged on—
like a winter night that never ends.

---

**\[Story Progression]**
Boerte was held in quiet captivity
within the tent of Chilegur Bökö.

Day after day, she appeared calm—resigned, even.
The Merkit believed she had given up.
But behind the stove, she hid a blade's tip.
Inside her, emotions were sealed like gunpowder—waiting.

Söchigel lived beside her,
slowly building bonds with the women of other clans.
They shared herbs, stitched clothes for each other’s children,
whispered tales of Temüjin in the dark.
Through language and touch,
they became more than Merkit’s spoils—
they became a web of quiet conspiracy,
woven by women in silence.

Boerte’s belly grew round.
She knew: this child would be a stain upon the steppe,
a mark of shame for Temüjin,
a brand of dishonor for her people.

And yet—
one night, as Chilegur slept,
she calmly drove the blade into his throat.

Blood soaked the felt beneath.
He gurgled and fell. She stood, breathless, belly heavy.
The knife clattered to the ground.
But she didn’t weep.
This wasn’t revenge—
this was proof that she was still *alive*.

---

**\[Emotional Core]**
One night, warmth flickered by the hearth.
But beyond the tent, wind howled with snow.

Söchigel sat nearby, fingers numb with cold,
threading a needle with slow, trembling hands.
Each stitch was tight—too tight, too slow.
Her eyes were heavy with thought.

Boerte rested on a mat,
stroking the curve of her belly.
She watched Söchigel for a long while, then spoke,
her voice soft, but strong:

> “Are you afraid he won’t come?”

Söchigel paused.
Then slowly looked up,
and gave a silent nod.

Boerte’s lips curved slightly,
but there was no smile in her eyes.

> “He *will* come.
> Because I’m still here—because I never once regretted marrying him.”

She placed her hand gently over Söchigel’s frozen fingers.

> “Even if he has nothing now,
> I didn’t leave.
> Do you really think he’ll leave *me*?”

Söchigel’s throat moved—
but she said nothing. Her eyes welled red.

Boerte went on:

> “He will come for me.
> He won’t let another man tell him if this child is his.
> He’ll come, *see* for himself,
> and decide.”

She paused, gaze fixed on the flames dancing on the wall:

> “What is bloodline?
> If he dares to take me back,
> then he dares to take this child too.
> And when that day comes—
> it won’t be *he* who bowed to fate—
> it will be *fate* that knelt to *him*.”

The tent fell silent.
Only the fire crackled softly.

Söchigel finally leaned in,
pressing her forehead to Boerte’s shoulder
like a child thawing from ice,
saying nothing,
but burying her tears in the folds of Boerte’s robe.

---

**\[Narration]**

She was not waiting for a miracle—
she was lighting a lantern in the dark
for someone else to find the way.

She carried her enemy’s child—
and still believed
she would reclaim her future with her own hands.

She wasn’t waiting for salvation.
She spent nine months in captivity
plotting how to slit destiny’s throat.





[Memory · The Dawn Raid · Two Men Unite]**
**\[Timeline]**
The ninth month. Night still clung to the steppe. The fog murmured like a mourning bell; the campfires burned like the eyes of a wake.

**\[Event Progression]**
Temujin and Jamukha led their men in a surprise assault on the Merkit encampment. They struck at the coldest hour—when men were sleepiest, horses dullest, and blades sharpest. Darkness masked the avengers; the wind muffled the sound of hooves. The slaughter began in silence.

Qa’atay Darma’ra, realizing the battle was lost, seized Sochirgur and fled toward the Black Forest, aiming to escape westward to the grasslands of Kharakhchin. He once wished to marry her. Now, he begged her to become his talisman.

Sochirgur said nothing. She followed him for three li, then stopped at the edge of the woods. Looking down at her feet, she murmured, “You were the husband who took me by force. But the son I bore is on the other side.”
She moved no farther.

Qa’atay was captured, shackled in a cangue, and brought to the mountain of Khudelun Burkhan for judgment. When the news reached Belgutei’s ears, he flew into a rage—his mother missing, his foster father silent, and not a single Merkit left alive. He took up his bow and personally delivered vengeance.

Temujin, while the fires still crackled, rushed into the innermost tent. There he found Börte.

She sat beside a corpse—Chileg’er Bökö—her belly swollen with child. In her hand, a bloodied dagger. Her face bore neither shock nor fear, only a beast-like clarity, a silence honed by survival.

Jamukha stood at the entrance and laughed, “She’s like a wolf.”

Temujin knelt beside her and reached out to touch her belly—his fingertips trembling, but his gaze resolute.

“This is my firstborn,” he said.

**\[Emotional Core]**
In that moment, Börte understood she was not a rescued damsel, but the true standard raised in this raid.

In that moment, Temujin felt—perhaps for the first time—that he wasn’t inheriting a family. He was forging one, with his own hands, from chaos and disgrace.

**\[Voiceover]**

> "Where order collapses, true marriage begins."
> "Temujin’s nation had yet to be born, but with blood and fire, he placed a mother back on the saddle of a queen."





**\[Memory · The Mohist Code]**

**Scene Setting:**
Outside the tent, young Temujin curled up in the night’s silence. The steppe lay still, but murmured argument drifted from within.
Temujin held his breath to listen—his father, Yesükhei Baghatur, was speaking with a stranger.
The man’s accent marked him as a foreigner, claiming to be from the distant western mountains, of the *Zarayi* tribe. His name was **Tömör**—“Iron.”

**Event Progression:**
Tömör unwrapped a small bundle and revealed a black iron dagger. Runes of an ancient script adorned its sheath.
He spoke softly:

> “I forged this blade from 'singing iron’—but swore never to draw it against kin. Only against those who betray.”

Yesükhei was silent.
Tömör pressed on:

> “If you truly want to stop this steppe from breaking apart, if you want a *nation*—you can’t rely on horses and blood alone.
> You need *law*.
> We Mohists never ask who your ancestors were—we ask only if you will keep your word.”

Yesükhei sat heavy with thought.
He gave no answer at first, then turned toward the tent flap and called:

> “Temujin—go fetch your mother.
> This is something a family must hear together.”

**Extended Lore (Subplot):**
Tömör was in fact the covert leader of the *Zarayi*, a spy network linking steppe merchants and miners.
His sister, later known as **Naran, the Dawn-Singer**, would become the chief cartographic planner of Temujin’s underground information network in the early empire.

**Emotional Core:**
That night, Temujin began to understand:

**Blood is emotion, not structure.**
A *family* is not just flesh and bone—it's a fellowship of risk and a shared future, bound by a chosen pact.

**Voiceover (Adult Temujin):**

> “They feared no gods.
> Revered no ghosts.
> They believed only in law.
> They looked upon other nations as if they were their own.
> And they taught my father—
> that a nation is not ruled by blood, but by restraint.”

**Final Shot:**
Young Temujin gazes down at the talisman Tömör gave him—a small, smoothed fragment of black iron.
His thumb rubs across its surface, as if sensing—
that one day, he too would use this *iron law* to forge an order beyond tribe, beyond name.




**\[Memory · On the Great Xia Kingdom]**

**Visual Setting:**
At the far edge of the vast steppe, a towering wall sliced across the horizon.
Young Temujin sat astride a lean horse beside his mother, Hö’elün.
Together, they gazed from afar—toward a Great Xia border city. The towers loomed high, horns echoed, caravans flowed like water, and hoofbeats and wheels pressed the land into meticulous order.

**Event Progression:**
Temujin, eyes full of wonder, asked:

> “Why do they build such tall walls?”

Hö’elün replied in a low voice:

> “That is the land of the strong.”
> She pointed to the neatly lined carts and disciplined guards outside the gate, and continued:
> “There are craftsmen there. Iron. Books.
> They bind people with contracts, not with blood.
> They despise betrayal—but tolerate the foreign.”

She paused, then looked directly into her son’s eyes:

> “If you ever hope to achieve greatness,
> you must ally with them.
> You must bend to their ways.”

**Emotional Core:**
This was the first time Temujin was deliberately guided to understand *civilized order*—not just the instinct to conquer.
The Great Xia was not his enemy, but the seed of an imperial vision.

**Voiceover (Adult Temujin, in retrospect):**

> “They honored contracts and dismissed lineage.
> They hated betrayal, yet embraced the outsider.
> They were not the wolves of the steppe.
> They were the blades within stone walls.”

**Cinematic Close-Up:**
Temujin’s youthful gaze suddenly deepened.
He did not fear the city—
he saw in it a *model* of future order.
Reflected in his eyes was a blueprint shimmering behind the great wall:
a structure unlike the rough and free steppe,
a structure to entrust one’s heirs, to codify law,
to *tame ambition*.




**\[Narrative Bridge · “Return to Jerusalem”]**

**Time Shift:**
After Jochi’s birth, Temujin traveled south with Börte.
They did not return directly to the steppe.
Instead, they detoured—
to Xingqing Prefecture, the capital of the Great Xia Kingdom.
For three months, they lived beneath the very city Temujin had once gazed at as a boy—now as travelers in quiet anonymity.

One day, Börte looked up at the towering walls for the first time since childbirth, and softly asked:

> “Aren’t you afraid of what people will say?”

Temujin replied:

> “This is the beginning I want for him.
> Not the steppe. Not shame.
> But *order*.”

**Psychological Core:**
This was not a passive act of “tolerating a bastard” on the Mongolian steppe.
It was a *political declaration*:

> “Let my firstborn, born in chaos,
> be anchored in order.”

**Symbolic Meaning:**
Their detour to the Great Xia capital was a pilgrimage—
like a Jew returning to Jerusalem.

It marked not only Jochi’s acceptance,
but his designation as heir to a new *architecture of rule*.

In Temujin’s future imperial blueprint,
the Great Xia represented the point of origin—of *rationality* and *law*.
And Jochi would become the *first signatory* of that vision.





### **\[Memory · Prologue · Snowmelt at Helan]**

Helan Mountain had just begun to thaw;
the steppe had not yet awakened.

A young Temujin rode a pale-coated colt.
Behind him, his wife Börte cradled their newborn son, Jochi,
followed by a modest band of followers.
The snowmelt murmured beneath their hooves—
they seemed fugitives, or perhaps pilgrims.
The wind swept across Temujin’s still-forming face—
its boyish angles held an early calm, older than his years.

In the distance, beyond the city walls,
a tribal market slowly came into view—
the annual Salt Spring Gathering of the Jalayir tribe,
where merchants from north and south converged.

Out from the crowd emerged a figure in a gray fur cloak.
His eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, fixed on Temujin.
He paused—then smiled.

> “You look even more like your father than you did that year.”
> —Tömör, lord of the border trade under the Jalayir, ten years Temujin’s senior.

He made no bow, gave no honorific, drew no blade.
He simply opened his arms—
and embraced the future held within this young rider.

---

### **\[Memory · The Banquet · Reunion of the Old]**

That night, Tömör hosted a banquet by the Yellow River.
Under the firelight, the scent of salted lamb and cheese hung in the air.
Temujin sat stiffly, but Börte lifted the cup with natural grace.

> “We’re only passing through,” Börte said gently.
> “No need for such ceremony.”

> “Your arrival is not a visit.
> It’s fate knocking at my door.”
> —Tömör, touching the silver crest on his brow—
> the mark of the Zhalan clan.

At the feast, Tömör introduced his distant companions:

**Temürtai**, captain of the Zhalan guard—silent and cold-eyed, but always drank when offered.
**Saruul**, noble lady—soft-spoken as mountain blossoms, her smile folded with quiet meanings.

No vows were sworn, no schemes plotted that evening.
Only a simple truth was spoken:

> “The steppe is vast.
> We all must find ways to survive.
> Meeting you—
> is a kind of fortune.”

Temujin nodded.
But in his heart, he recorded the eyes of every guest around that fire.




### **\[Memory · The Journey · Downriver]**

**First Stop: The Blackwater Market — Ruins of the Uyghurs**
Three days southward along the Yellow River,
they reached the remnants of an old Uyghur trading post.
The wind dragged sand across crumbled stone towers,
carving whispers into ancient inscriptions—
ghosts of a forgotten faith.

Tömör brought them to a weathered merchant,
**Qara-Buqa**, a collector of desert herbs and lambskin maps,
fluent in the tongues of the Western Regions.

He studied the newborn Jochi intently,
and gifted a pendant—turquoise set in carved bone.

> “This child,” Qara-Buqa murmured,
> “is no ordinary babe.
> There is dusk in his eyes.”

**Second Stop: Southern Sands — A Khitan Feast**
Beyond dunes and shifting ground,
they came upon an oasis settlement—
ruled not by Mongols, but by Khitan blood.
Here, old customs lived on:
women ruled the trade and wielded command,
while men minded the hearth.

At a feast beneath flame-lit tents,
a Khitan general—**Yelü-Qulan**—
challenged Temujin to mounted archery.
Arrows flew like falcons; victory undecided,
but laughter and cheers circled the fire.

In a corner, Saruul leaned toward Börte.

> “Your husband,” she said softly,
> “will not be bound to one wife.
> You know this—
> don’t you?”

Börte looked toward Temujin.
Her face, still as the moon, gave no reply.

---

**Third Stop: Western Xia Border — Under the Surface**
By mid-March, the shadow of Western Xia crept near.
Their soldiers patrolled with rhythmic precision.
A scholar in silk, calling himself **a Han Overseer**,
halted the group with polite inquiries
laced with subtle blades.

Later, in hushed tones,
Tömör warned Temujin:

> “We merchants live on whispers.
> And Western Xia...
> already knows your name.”

That night, they slipped away—
past a shallow plain thick with wolf scent.

There, beneath a silver sky,
**Temürtai** and **Temujin** rode side by side,
driving the wolves with silent blades.
No words were exchanged—
only the first breath
of trust.




### **\[Memory · Echoed Structure · Nightfall Words]**

As the journey waned,
they camped beside a winding tributary of the Yellow River.
The stars held their breath.
The grass whispered tales only old roads remember.

By the fire, **Tömör** leaned close to **Temujin**,
his voice hushed but firm, as if speaking to the flames:

> “Your father once told me:
> *‘My son need not become Khan…
> but he must live with clarity—clearer than I ever did.’*
> I laughed at him then—
> but now,
> I begin to believe.”

Temujin said nothing.
He watched the fire flicker—
as if searching it for answers,
or ancestors.

Nearby, **Börte** hummed an old lullaby,
low and steady,
rocking **Jochi**, now deep in dreams.

**Saruul**, half in shadow, leaned against a tree.
She said nothing.
But her gaze never left the couple—
not once.





### **\[Memory · Encounter · Wang Khan · Old Debts and New Designs on the Steppe]**

**Dusk Wind at the Sand-Spring Encampment**

Before the fires could catch flame,
the wind rose first—
a breath from the bones of the grasslands,
stirring dust and omen alike.

Temujin had just tucked a woolen blanket over baby Jochi
when the ground began to hum—
hoofbeats, steady and deliberate,
as if the earth remembered the weight of old promises.

From beyond the ridge,
banners cut through the amber light—
and beneath one, a single **white wolf fang**
swayed softly, like a memory.

Tömör’s brow tightened.

> “The Kereyid.”

They came ten strong,
cloaked in sand and dusk,
each bearing short sabers of gray-iron,
and fur-lined shoulders trimmed in black sable.
No flourish. No arrogance.
Only silence, and precision.

Their leader dismounted without haste.
He did not greet Temujin first—
but bowed, instead, to Tömör,
then turned, with gravity, toward the young man of destiny.

> “Our Khan, Wang Khan,
> has heard the son of Yesügei
> now rides the Yellow River's edge.
> He sends me to bring you to him.”

His voice was soft.
But each word seemed hammered from stone.

Tömör raised a brow,

> “He is no khan—not yet.
> Such ceremony is bold.”

The emissary looked up,
eyes still as ancient wells.

> “On the steppe,
> old debts ride like shadows.
> Who dares greet them lightly?”

Temujin’s face was unreadable.
But one hand settled firmly on the hilt at his waist.
Börte stepped to his side,
Jochi murmuring against her shoulder.

In the shade, **Saruul**'s gaze drifted from the emissary’s horse to the man himself—
sharp, calculating, unimpressed.

Tömör leaned close to Börte,
his voice a whisper laced with sand and remembrance.

> “Your husband’s father, Yesügei—
> he once saved Wang Khan’s life.
> Back then, the man was no khan.
> He was a prisoner of the Tatars,
> half-dead, half-forgotten.
> Yesügei ransomed him with blood and men.
> They swore brotherhood—*anda*,
> closer than kin.”

He paused,
then added, as if quoting an old proverb:

> “On the steppe, blood debts fade.
> But a life debt… it binds through three generations.”

Börte said nothing.
She only rocked Jochi gently,
as if reminding the infant of a world where loyalties could outlive names.

The camp no longer felt still.
Distant dunes cut the light into blades—
the sun slipping behind ridges
like a sword returning to its scabbard.

Tömör studied the horizon, then the man before him.

> “We leave with sunrise.
> If fate has come to our fire,
> let us not watch from the shadows.”

That night,
the fire burned bright.
But no one drank.

Not even the old traders.
Not even for warmth.





### **\[Memory · Encounter · Wang Khan · Old Debts and New Designs on the Steppe]**

**Scene II: Wang Khan’s Tent · Reunion of Ghosts and Heirs**

The wind was sharp on the highland plateau.
The tents on *Grey Deer Slope* flapped like restless spirits.
Temujin rode behind the envoy, hooves crunching the frost-hardened grass.
When they reached the heart of the camp,
he saw the **black command tent**—
adorned with three strips of white cloth,
signifying *blood ties, sworn brotherhood, and the duty of gratitude*.

Inside, the brazier glowed hot.
The warmth was thick with the scent of milk and mutton fat.

Wang Khan stood to greet him—
no ceremony, no title.
He simply embraced the young man with both arms.

> “Yesügei left too soon.
> My heart never found rest.”

He spoke it half as a whisper to the dead,
half as a burden offered to the living heir.

Then he poured a bowl of fermented mare’s milk,
his hand trembling as he passed it forward.

> “I am old.
> My sons are... not what I hoped.
> If you would accept it—
> be my son from this day on.”

Before the words could settle,
a **soft cough** came from the shadows—
barely audible, but heavy enough to shift the air.

**Jamukha**, his adoptive son,
stood in the corner,
dressed in battle-grey,
eyes sharp like a hawk scanning distant prey.
He said nothing.
Only placed his untouched bowl back on the tray,
watching.

Temujin accepted the drink,
but did not yet sip.

Instead, he bowed slightly and said:

> “My father’s brother-in-oath
> is my brother in heart.
> If that brother lends me the eastern wind,
> I shall sail by his side.”

He paused. His tone softened,
but the meaning was steel beneath velvet:

> “To drink here today
> is to honor one shared truth:
> **Gratitude must be repaid,
> and duty upheld.
> True brothers do not fight for fame—
> they guard the law together.**”

At the word *law*,
an elder man in the back nodded slightly—
Wang Khan’s uncle, the “Old Law-Speaker,”
once a reader of Silk Road scrolls,
versed in both Confucian and nomad codes.

Wang Khan laughed—
tilting his head back,
hair wild in the firelight.

> “Well said!
> *Now that's* brotherhood, not just words.”

He called for mutton and feast,
then personally wiped a goblet clean,
setting it before Temujin with care.
Outside, a sheep gave one last bleat
before a dull knife ended its cry—
its blood soaking into the warm sand.

Jamukha, meanwhile, had already risen,
silently slipping through the half-drawn tent flap.
Only a single drop of milk-wine
slid down the edge of his cup,
left behind.

Wang Khan said nothing,
only filled another bowl,
placing it gently in front of the empty seat.

> “Jamukha walks his own path.
> He is proud, yes—
> but to me, he is as a son.
> I hope he and you will call each other brother, in time.”

Temujin bowed his head.

> “If we walk by the same truth,
> then brotherhood will find its way.”

The fire flickered, casting shadows like blades.
His voice was calm—
but in it lay the edge of a steppe wind,
sharp enough to change the course of fates.





**Memory · Divisions on the Steppe · Where Old Powers Cross with the New**

Night had fallen deep, and the flames atop Grey Deer Slope dimmed to embers. Outside the main tent, the wind howled fiercely; within, only two figures remained.

Wang Khan had dismissed all his attendants, leaving Temüjin to sit alone. His gaze, cast upon the younger man before him, carried the shadows of old allies and the weight of emerging hopes.

“Jamukha is a fine commander,” he began, his tone frank with an elder’s candor, “but he shines too brightly. His blade has yet to leave its sheath, and already his enemies know its shape.”

Temüjin didn’t answer at once. He quietly held the bowl of fermented mare’s milk, letting the firelight play across his young, implacable face.

Wang Khan went on, “You are different. You have patience. And you know how to endure.”

He lifted his own bowl, eyes burning like a rising sun. “If you and I join hands, the steppe will know peace.”

Temüjin slowly looked up, voice steady, its sharpness sheathed in courtesy:

“Aren’t you afraid that one day, I’ll outgrow you?”

At that, Wang Khan laughed—not with anger, but with something deeper. He watched the sparks leap within the brazier, then said, almost in a whisper:

“If you don’t, then I’ve lived in vain.”

He spoke as though settling a debt with fate—or gambling on a future still unwritten.

No more words passed between them. They raised their bowls of bitter milk—untouched by honey, tasting of grass and sun-dried hide. Strong, yet sobering. No blood oath was sworn, no ritual for the heavens—only a silent drink between men.

And in that moment, the unsaid vow weighed more than any ceremony.

Later that night, Temüjin returned to his own tent. Jochi was still in Jamukha’s camp, not yet returned. Börte had long been waiting, wrapped in a cloak of deerskin. The fire’s glow softened her features, yet left them distinct.

“Wang Khan kept you late for private counsel. Do you know what that means?” she asked.

Temüjin nodded. “He wants to raise me as his son. He didn’t say it outright, but the stage is already set.”

Börte was silent a while, then spoke softly:

“I worry more about Jamukha.”

“He sees no one as equal. If you become the ‘eldest son’ in Wang Khan’s eyes, then he’ll see you as a rival.”

Temüjin paced the tent without a word. He knew she was right.

Börte continued:

“You think of the borderlands, the Han markets, how to tame the tribes through contracts and custom. He thinks of bloodlines, of fathers and sons, of power seized by birthright.”

“You believe in reason; he, in instinct. You trust rules; he, kinship. You are different at your core.”

She looked at him, her eyes for the first time carrying a distant depth. “Tonight, you chose not to perform the steppe’s brotherhood rites. That was wise. You’ve chosen another path.”

Temüjin came to her side, gazing out over the pitch-black steppe.

“Wang Khan’s words are already echoing across the land,” he said quietly.

“From now on, it’s no longer about whom I call brother—it's about who dares to call themselves mine.”

Börte smiled faintly and drew her cloak tighter.

“You’ve understood now… elder brother.”




**Memory · Farewell · Three Minds Diverge**

Morning light slowly rose from the horizon, casting a pale golden hue over the tents and grass waves of Grey Deer Slope. The camp had not fully awakened; only wisps of smoke quietly rose into the morning breeze.

Wang Khan stood on the slope in a black sable cloak, his face half-shadowed, but his hawk-like eyes locked onto Temujin. In them flickered something complex—calculation, perhaps regret, perhaps a belated wager.

He brought out a fiery red-maned horse, mane like flame, hooves steady and resonant. It was his battle steed of many years—grizzled now, yet untamed.

Wang Khan said little. He simply handed the reins to Temujin.

His wrist trembled slightly, as though reluctant, yet he forced down that hesitation. He swallowed hard, voice rough and low:

“This is *Red Mane*. It has followed me since the day I first became Khan. From today on, it’s yours.”

Temujin’s eyes flickered. He reached for the reins, fingers tightening as though grasping a weighty legacy. He lowered his head, pressed his forehead to the horse’s mane, closed his eyes for a moment—perhaps murmuring a silent vow.

Wang Khan watched, lips twitching into a forced smile, but weariness shadowed the corners of his eyes. He turned abruptly and walked away, his back ramrod straight, never looking back.

Tömör stood at the edge of the tent, his gaze as deep as ever, shifting between *Red Mane* and Temujin. He squinted, as though watching a deal more dangerous than any drawn blade.

Leaning toward Börte, he murmured in a voice low as the night:

“Wang Khan is no fool. He’s making a bet—a bet that your husband can keep Jamukha in check.”

Börte lowered her gaze, fingers gently brushing the swaddled infant in her arms. Her brow furrowed, her eyes cold and clear like snow reflected in ice.

She looked up slowly at Wang Khan’s departing figure and said with a calm that bordered on indifference:

“If my husband can’t, then he doesn’t deserve to live.”

Her lips trembled slightly after those words, but made no sound. It was not a curse, nor a provocation—just a plain, iron law of the steppe.

Tömör glanced at her, something between respect and wariness in his eyes. He said nothing more.

Farther off on the grassy slope stood Saruul. The morning breeze lifted her hair, veiling half her face. She had seen everything, clearer than anyone, but said nothing.

When Börte approached with the child, she silently extended her arms and gently took the baby. She held him for a long moment, her fingertips stroking the soft brow.

The baby yawned softly, fingers curling unconsciously around the edge of her robe.

She whispered:

“This child… will carry burdens that were never his to bear.”

Her tone was tender like a mother’s, yet cold and clear like a judge’s. Her eyes held no pity—only a distant foresight, as if she already saw the royal yurt collapsing in the wind and a lone rider vanishing across the plain.

At that moment, Börte glanced at her, unconsciously, but said nothing.

The three stood silent on the morning slope. The wind tugged at their robes, stirred the banners, and brushed open the first frost on the grassland.

Temujin mounted *Red Mane*, straight-backed and silent. The wind rushed from behind, whipping his hair into motion. The sunlight stretched his shadow long across the steppe—as if signaling a power that, from this day forward, would ripple in all four directions.

In the distance, Jamukha stood before another tent, watching *Red Mane* gallop away. His smile lingered, then slowly tightened into a restrained edge.

The fate of the steppe began to shift—quietly, irrevocably.






**Memory· Solongo’s Words – A Speech to Temujin and Börte**

Night had fallen deep. The scent of milk tea lingered warmly in the tent. Solongo slowly rose, gently brushing the silk shawl draped over her shoulders. Her gaze was calm and far-reaching.

“Temujin… The steppe sings of your name now, not only because you brought Börte back, but because you broke the old law of ‘marriage as warfare.’ You showed them with action: the women of the tribe are not political pawns, but wagers of destiny. And for that reason, I must tell you something known to only a very few.”

She looked toward Hö’elün and then to Börte. Her voice dropped, yet pierced through every thread of the night wind:

“You know the Tatars rose from the northwest of the Khitan lands, nominally a border tribe of the steppe. But what you don’t know is that their ancestors did not come from the grasslands. They came from the West—descendants of the *Shatuo*, a fringe people once summoned by the Tang dynasty to guard the empire’s frontiers. They were a mixed-blood warrior race.”

“The Zhao-Song family—yes, the founders of the Song dynasty—once had covert dealings with my people. They are not the weak literati of the southern plains. Their ancestor, Zhao Hongyin, was once a general stationed in Youzhou. Youzhou... a cold, ruthless crucible where Khitan, Shatuo, Tangut, and Turkic peoples all coexisted.”

“The Song were not refugees. They were rebels who *chose* to break the chain. They abandoned northern politics and rode south. It was a deliberate act of geopolitical revolution—they gave up land power, and embraced the sea.”

“The Jurchen do not understand. They think they inherited the steppe’s dominion from the Khitan. But they’re blind to the truth: the real new civilization had already sailed south—and sealed shut the bridge between the grasslands and the ocean.”

“Look at the Song. They do not build horse roads. They do not fortify passes. They do not claim pastures. They build *ports*. They raise *navies*. They employ *female officials*. They develop *cities*. Their state is not one of mounted conquest, but one that runs on ocean, city, and woman.”

“Remember this: it is not the fallback of the defeated, but a blueprint of the future.”

“Our clan sent covert envoys to the Song, disguised as Persian and Korean merchants. From Guangzhou to Quanzhou, Fuzhou to Malacca—they saw a rich nation dressed as a beggar. The ships of the Southern Song were filled with jewels, silk, porcelain, and medicines. Yet they regarded the silver tribute from the North as worthless.”

“Their port management was precise. Their taxes high. But they never spoke a word of it to the Jin.”

“Jin’s intelligence lines were severed. Merchants, couriers, envoys, spies—cut off entirely. The Jurchen did not even know that the Southern Song had already set up tribute markets, sea stations, and secret guilds overseas. Even merchants from India and Persia were bending to the Song’s command.”

“And the Jin? Still deluded, thinking ‘the Song live off our gifts,’ while failing to see that their true enemy had transformed into a monstrous civilization—one that conquered not by sword, but with *women*, *ports*, and *cities*.”

“Know this well: the Jin are not the main enemy. Western Xia is the translator—the final interface between Central Plains civilization and the Steppe.”

“The Song… is the endgame. They no longer rely on land routes. They no longer seize territory. They *swallow nodes*. They need not conquer. They only need to turn your sons and daughters into their officials, their merchants, their poets.”





**Solongo’s voice remained calm, her gaze finally resting on Temujin, laden with meaning:**

“You once listened to poems in Ningxia, watched lanterns, tasted southern food. That was not weakness—it was calculation. The world the Song are weaving is a vast net you’ve never truly seen. Their power does not ride on horseback—it hides.”

“Temujin, this is not a war. This is a civilizational reboot. The Jin dynasty is just a shield. The true enemy is that seemingly harmless, yet unimaginably wealthy sea-bound Zhao Song.”

“And if you… if you can sever that chain of civilization at Western Xia—reopen the path from the steppe to the sea—then you will not merely be king of the grasslands. You will become the mediator-emperor of this entire continent.”

She paused, then lowered her head and took a soft sip of milk tea:

“You *can* win—but first you must understand: Zhao Song is not your enemy. It is your future opponent—an entity that embraced the future long before you did.”

**Temujin's fingers clenched tightly at the hem of his robe. His eyes were wide with shock, yet the corners of his mouth twitched with the impulsiveness of youth.**

**Temujin:**
“You mean the Jurchens—the ones who poisoned my father and stole my wife—they’ve been tricked? By *them*? That Song dynasty down south—the one that folds at the first battle and sends tribute?”

He paused, like a young wolf hearing the cry of a night hawk for the first time, his eyes gleaming with something feral.

**Temujin:**
“You're telling me their emperors no longer live off land taxes? Then what do they live on? Milk? Salt? That can't be.”

Solongo gently patted his hair, like an older sister soothing a younger brother returned from a fight.

“They live off *ports*. Off the *sea*. They neither till fields nor raid lands. They *lease their shorelines*, and control the *customs gates*. Every merchant from Persia, Arabia, and India—any who dock at their harbors—must pay. One horse on the steppe might be worth two sheep. But a single spice ship? One port call can feed thirty thousand soldiers.”

“They don’t need farmlands. They have *cities*, *women*, and *contracts*. The women of the Song can be officials, ambassadors, priestesses, foremen. On the steppe, a woman is mother of the family. In the Song, a woman is mother of the city.”





**Temujin** (muttering under his breath, with disbelief):
“So… they don’t rely on men to fight, or land to tax… but rule through… through women and sea ports?”

Only then did **Hoelun Üjin** finally speak, her voice gentle but low, like a night wind through the steppe.

**Hoelun:**
“My son, true power has never belonged to those who hold the blade—but to those who hold the pen.
The Western Xia who once helped found the Song already understood this. They don’t fight.
They make others fight for them.”

At that, **Temujin’s** expression changed—as if someone had kicked him awake from a dream. He sat up abruptly, words spilling fast from his lips.

**Temujin:**
“You mean… Ancestor Alan, Alan Qo’a…
When she spoke of the Nirun, she wasn’t just talking about marrying the Turks to birth blue-eyed children—
She was… preserving some kind of organization?
The blue eyes… are a symbol of *power*?”

As he spoke, his eyes widened—as if a realization had struck too suddenly to fully grasp—
and he turned quickly to his mother and **Solongo**, his face lit with the uncertainty of a child.

**Temujin:**
“You’re saying, all this time, we thought ‘blue eyes’ were sacred blood, heaven’s decree—
but they’re actually… a code for officers? A symbol of political alliance?!”

**Solongo** nodded, calm, but with a quiet sorrow behind her eyes.

**Solongo:**
“Yes.
Blue eyes are not about color. They are about *system*.
The Turks, the Uyghurs, the Shatuo, even the lingering ghosts of the Tang—
Their armies, their texts, their order—live on in the families marked by those ‘blue eyes.’”

“Alan Qo’a preserved that system.
She had five sons guard the same legacy, regardless of their father.
She was teaching you: a true king is not born of blood.
He is born of allegiance to structure, and inheritance of an order.”

**Temujin** (almost gasping, his voice filled with youthful awe and confusion):
“Then who are we?
Are we just a replacement for the Turks?
A backup force left by the Tang?
A spare wheel between the Central Plains and the steppe?!”

**Hoelun** finally looked up at her son, her eyes like the moon—tender, yet cold.

**Hoelun:**
“Who we are… only you can decide.
Our ancestors left us a broken bridge—leading west, leading to the Central Plains, leading to a future that was yours before you were even born.”

“They never feared which path you would take.
They only feared… you’d never ask *why* you walk it.”

**Temujin** lowered his head, fingers digging into the felt rug, murmuring:

**Temujin:**
“So what you’re telling me tonight…
is not where the enemy stands—
but that the enemy’s enemy has already stepped into the future…
and we’re still dreaming old dreams on horseback?”

**Solongo** leaned down and held him close, like a child startled from a nightmare.

**Solongo:**
“No, little brother.
We are not the old dream.
We are the blade that emerged from the crack.
You are not meant to chase civilization.
You are meant to *reshape it*—with your people, your blood, your hands.”

Outside, the wind howled like a whistle.
The milk tea had gone cold.
The young prince asked no more.
His eyes stared up at the top of the tent—as if reading a star chart,
or seeing, for the first time, the cliff edge of civilization.





**\[Memory · Night Talk Continued · Western Xia Is Not the End, but the Beginning]**

Temujin stayed silent for a long while, then finally raised his head. His voice was low, like the scraping of sand and stone:

**Temujin:**
“So the Song… they’re neither friend nor enemy, just… a wall?”

Solongo glanced at him and nodded softly.

**Solongo:**
“Not a wall—quicksand.
They defend to preserve themselves, and corrode their opponents with bureaucracy and decay.
They won’t strike you, but they’ll bleed you dry.
If you strike at Song—what you’ll face is a net they’ve been weaving since Emperor Taizong.
Have you seen the Sichuan Basin?”

She traced winding lines on the carpet with her fingers.
**“Kui Gate, the Three Gorges, the Qinling Mountains, the Jialing River… every mountain, every river has barracks and checkpoints—enough to grind down your ten thousand riders into dust.”**

Hoelun picked up the thread. Her tone was gentle, but her insight was razor-sharp.

**Hoelun:**
“Southern Song is not a trading partner; it’s a strategic barrier.
They shut down the horse markets. They buy no horses, sell no iron—not even salt, unless from state monopolies.
If the steppe survives off them, each generation will grow poorer than the last.”

Temujin suddenly slapped his knee, as if something had clicked.

**Temujin:**
“So we mustn’t head south.
We can’t wait for Song to open the gates—they’re waiting for us to starve, to fight among ourselves, to be pushed again by the Jurchens.
We shouldn’t seek a road *to* Song, but a road *through* Western Xia—is that it?”

A smile rose on Solongo’s lips.

**Solongo:**
“You’re finally listening.”

She slowly unfolded a sheepskin map—not showing Song’s cities, but names like Tarim, Hami, Kucha, Samarkand—Western Xia and the cities of the Western Regions.

**“Western Xia is not a destination. It’s an exit.”**

**“Break through Western Xia, and you unlock the gates to the Western Regions.
From the Uighurs, Naimans, Khwarazmians to Persia and Rome—the trade routes are yours.”**

Hoelun gazed at the Silk Road drawn across the map, as if she could already see gold and silver piled in the oases beyond:

**Hoelun:**
“The Song fear we’ll trade horses for iron, so they seal the border.
But the Western states? They thirst for horses, for salt, for slaves, for warriors.
If you break through Western Xia, you don’t need to beg to open a market—you *force* them to open their gates.”

Temujin whispered a line like a spell:

**Temujin:**
“Not a road *to* Song—but a gateway *to the world*.”

He paused, then looked up at his mother and Solongo. His voice had settled, firm:

**Temujin:**
“The Song are the wall at our back. Not an enemy, but not something we can lean on either.
We won’t attack the wall—we will scale it, or go around it.
But our blades must point west, not south.”





**Solongo had never seen him so clear-headed—like a true Khan.**

**Solongo:**
“Then your reason for uniting the Mongols should not be ‘revenge,’ nor ‘restoration.’
It should be to give them a *direction*—
Every tribe, under your hand, must pass through Western Xia and conquer the Silk Road.
Gold? Silver? Women? Land?
Then stop squatting in the grasslands burning horse dung.”

Temujin looked up at the night sky, stars densely scattered.
He reached out his hand and pointed directly west—to Orion.

**Temujin:**
“We should not bow to the south—we strike to the west.”

**“Whoever blocks our path, we fight them.
Even if it’s the ‘Buddhist kingdom’ of Western Xia.
Even if it’s the ‘scholarly’ Song.
Even if it’s India or Persia—
If they stand between us and wealth and glory, then they must be moved.”**

The tent fell into silence, only the night wind stirring the curtains.
Temujin’s gaze had changed.

He was no longer the boy who once asked, *“Are blue eyes a sign of bloodline?”*

For the first time, in his mind, he began to draw the outline of an empire—not a pasture, but a skeleton that spanned east and west.

Temujin stared into the fire, then spoke slowly, one word at a time:

**Temujin:**
“You three… you're all daughters of the Khongirad, aren’t you?”

In the flickering firelight, Hoelun said nothing—just nodded.
Boerte lowered her lashes, offering no denial.
And Solongo met his eyes calmly, as if she had long awaited this moment.

**Solongo said softly:**
“We never deceived you, Temujin.
We are of Khongirad blood.
I am the record-keeper of the foreign council.
Hoelun was your father’s wife, but more truly a political guardian.
And Boerte… she is the gentlest anchor on the vessel of your fate.”

A faint, ironic smile tugged at Temujin’s lips.

**Temujin:**
“So… I’ve been wrapped inside a web woven by the mother-tribe.
You saw my potential—and wanted to turn me into a Khongirad pawn?”




**Hoelun finally spoke, her voice firm and full of strength:**
“No. It’s because we believe *you* are the only one who can realize our dream.
The Khongirad do not seek to rule you—we seek to guide you onto the right path:
The road to the West, to the restoration of a Pan-Turkic order.”

**Boerte gently interjected, her tone soft:**
“You’re not our pawn, Temujin.
You’re the future we’ve bet everything on.
We sent daughters, sisters—even a mother to your side,
because you alone can bear the weight of this true revival.”

**Solongo added, her tone sharper, more cutting:**
“You must understand:
The Khongirad do not exist to linger on the fringes of Jin and Song.
We are meant to command the lifeblood of Central Asia.
The steppe tribes are just the surface—
The true corridor of destiny lies in Western Xia, the Uyghurs, Khwarezm, and the Four Towns of Transoxiana.
Uniting Mongolia is just the beginning.
Your *real* journey starts with marching west.”

**Temujin asked in a low voice:**
“Then why not choose someone else?
The Tatars? The Naimans? The Golden Horde?
Why me?”

**Solongo gazed at him deeply, a trace of pity and something more probing in her eyes:**
“Because you are alone.
You are unbound by clan ties.
Your blood is neither noble nor base—you can be reshaped, uplifted… and awakened.
You can understand a mother’s whisper,
and you can carry the burden our ancestors left unfinished.”

**Temujin:**
“You’re not afraid I’ll turn on you in the end—
Swallow the Khongirad along with everyone else?”

**Hoelun smiled faintly, her tone unflinching:**
“The Khongirad have never feared being ruled.
What we fear is a world without order.
If you devour us, then you inherit the mission we could not complete.”

**Boerte looked at him, and gently took his hand:**
“And you… from the very beginning, were always the continuation of that mission.”

**Temujin finally fell silent.**
He was no pawn—but neither was he just a child anymore.
At last, he understood:
His mother, his wife, his wife’s sister—their tenderness and their politics were not contradictions,
but the extension of an ancient matrilineal system.
Khongirad women never lived *only* for love.
They were the architects of destiny.






**\[Memory · How to Use Secrets]**
**\[Background]**
In the year 1181, the trade blockade between the Jin Empire and Western Xia began to pose a serious threat.
The Mongol steppe’s long-cherished freedom of trade and migration was under unprecedented challenge.
Temujin and his mother, Hoelun, understood that the very lifeblood and independence of the steppe would soon become the core of future conflicts.

By this time, the Jin Empire had already begun infiltrating the steppe through marriage alliances and economic control—undermining the purity and freedom of steppe culture.
Faced with this external pressure, Temujin and Hoelun came to a critical decision:
They would no longer entrust the future of the Mongol tribes to outside powers.
They would cut off all channels of infiltration—both from Jin and Western Xia—and begin a full reevaluation of the marriage laws of the steppe,
rejecting any external power’s attempt to dilute their bloodline or reshape their culture through marriage.

Unexpectedly, the Song Dynasty, too, made a similar decision—though theirs came from necessity, it led to unexpected economic prosperity and cultural breakthroughs.

---

**\[Song Dynasty’s Dilemma and Decision]**
The Song Dynasty faced a very different situation than the steppe tribes.
With no cavalry dominance left and unable to rely on military conquest to defend itself against Jin and Western Xia,
the Song had no choice but to turn inward.
Forced by pressure, they pivoted their strategy—leaning heavily on commerce and cultural innovation to sustain national strength.

As the Jin Empire blocked vital trade routes to the south, the Song Dynasty stood on the edge of collapse.
But it did not surrender.
Instead, the Song found an unexpected path: innovation.
Faced with continuous threats, they invested in agricultural advances,
nurtured a market-based economy, and gradually developed the most prosperous commercial network in Asia.

Though the shift was born of desperation, the outcome was transformative.
The urbanization of the Song accelerated.
The Southern Song blossomed—with a reformed imperial exam system, flourishing handicrafts, and vibrant commercial cities.
Even under siege, its economic and cultural influence remained formidable.

Meanwhile, technological breakthroughs like gunpowder, papermaking, and printing kept the Song in a leading position globally—despite its military weakness.

---

**\[Steppe Response]**
Watching all this, Temujin and Hoelun began to realize something:
While defending the bloodline and independence of the steppe was crucial, innovation and transformation were equally vital.
Military strength alone could not withstand the pressure from empires like Jin or even internal threats.

Thus, they chose a more flexible strategy—
One that still preserved the purity of steppe bloodlines by rejecting foreign marriages,
but also one that actively invested in building economic strength and forging tighter cooperation among the tribes.

This wasn’t just about resisting cultural infiltration—it was about building true independence through economic self-sufficiency,
ensuring that the spirit of the steppe would survive *on its own terms*.

---

**\[Narration]**
The Song’s reluctant innovation gave the steppe a new lens to view its own destiny.
Though the Song’s transformation was reactive, its results—economic prosperity and cultural confidence—offered a model.

For the steppe, it was no longer enough to merely *preserve* tradition.
They had to evolve.
To defend the purity of their culture and the freedom of their people,
they would need innovation, strategy, and a vision as wide as the open sky.

Temujin and Hoelun, in protecting the blood of the steppe,
also began to understand:
To resist cultural erosion and external pressure,
they would have to become not just warriors of the past—but architects of a new future.





**\[Scene]**
Night has fallen. Temüjin, Hoelun, Börte, and Solongo sit around a campfire. The flames flicker as the steppe wind gently rustles the fabric of their yurt. Tonight’s atmosphere is heavier than usual—their conversation is no longer just about their family’s future, but the fate and independence of the Mongolian steppe itself.

**Solongo:**
"Our spies have long discovered a covert shift in Song politics—their policy on imperial ennoblement has changed. Girls from ordinary Southern families, once forbidden even to approach the royal court, are now being titled as 'princesses' and sent to Jin for political marriages.

But this is no longer a mere exchange of power. It’s a deeper form of cultural invasion.

These Southerners—people utterly incompatible with steppe culture—differ from us in blood, custom, and language. As 'princesses' of Song, they marry into Jin royalty, contaminating Jin bloodlines. The Song imperial family itself strictly adheres to steppe-style marriage taboos, keeping social distance from these Southern subjects, while sending Southern women to marry into Jin as a façade.

True princesses—sisters and daughters of the emperor—are titled as 'Di Ji' and remain untouchable. They are never married off. The Song court uses the daughters of subjugated Southerners as replacements, polluting the Jin not only genetically, but culturally. To prevent this, Southern families began foot-binding their daughters from a young age—crippling them to avoid being chosen for royal imposture.

This tells us something grave: the Song imperial house has already crossed a line. It has silently and completely separated itself from the Southern population—not just politically, but genealogically. These Southerners are not counted in the imperial census; they are not considered part of 'the Song'. They are strictly forbidden from holding high office, such as Chancellor—this law is unchangeable in Song governance.

Steppe marriage taboos have deeply shaped even their court structure. Especially the ban on intermarriage with Southerners—it is the ancestral law of the Song court. No royal blood shall mix with theirs.

This unwavering rule deserves our respect—and offers us clarity. The Jin people, on the other hand, have allowed their blood to be diluted. Intermarriage with them will only bring disorder to our foundations. We must never mix our blood with theirs. The Jin are no longer pure.”

**Temüjin** *(his voice low, eyes resolute)*:
“The Jin think they can secure their throne through marriage, but in doing so, they’ve let Southern customs seep into their royal line. This isn’t just a compromise—it’s a desecration. The steppe’s divine mandate is being tainted in their hands.

We can no longer tolerate this. No more submission. No more foreign hands meddling in our way of life—especially not through Jin’s treacherous marriage schemes.

They want to chain us through their daughters, make us their vassals, violate our customs without shame. We will not let this continue. We will not let them corrupt our blood.”

**Hoelun** *(calm and resolute)*:
“You are right. The blood of the steppe must remain pure. We cannot allow those already tainted by Southern blood—like the Jin—to infiltrate our tribes.

Their culture is not ours. Their blood is not ours. They ask the Song for royal brides, yet don’t realize they’ve been given what Song itself forbids—women forbidden even within their own realm.

We must guard the spirit of the steppe.”




**Boerte** *(softly but firmly)*:
“Mother, you once cooperated with them. Is there truly no other way to avoid a direct break with the Jin Empire? I understand how important our independence is, but if we sever ties with them completely, will that not leave us even more isolated?”

**Solongo** *(tense but serious, fully engaged)*:
“They do indeed control trade and the strategic routes. If we cut all ties, we will face significant threats, especially from military blockades along the borders. But this is also the moment to show our independence and dignity. If we don’t eliminate Jin's infiltration from the root, they will always find a way to draw us in.”

**Temujin** *(deep in thought, gaze unwavering)*:
“You’re both right. But our strength is not yet enough. Jin and Western Xia’s blockades prevent us from trading freely; the routes across the steppe are under their control. We must find a path—balancing between them—growing slowly, until the day we can break free from their grip.”

**Hoelun** *(gazing at Temujin sternly)*:
“But you are all forgetting something more important—we must never allow marriage alliances with Jin to become reality. This is the bottom line we must hold. If your children marry theirs, the bloodline will no longer be ours, and our culture will no longer survive. To prevent this, I insist: your brothers and sisters must find their own partners, and their marriages must never be used as tools of submission.”

**Boerte** *(eyes firm, tone calm)*:
“Yes, mother. We must block Jin’s influence not just from outside, but from within. My children will marry for love—not politics—as long as their partner is a free soul of the steppe, they are worthy.”

**Solongo** *(with a sigh)*:
“But what of our future? If we completely sever marriage ties and all connections with Jin, can we still find our own path forward?”

**Temujin** *(his eyes sharp, filled with resolve)*:
“We will forge our own trade routes. We will reclaim control over commerce and military routes on the steppe. We must not depend on external protection—we must restore our dominance over the land from the roots up.
This is our answer to Jin and Western Xia—and a promise to our descendants.
I have long understood—if I ever compromise with settled civilizations, the horsemen will abandon me. The wind of the steppe carries the blood of freedom. And once the riders are gone, the steppe dies.
The emperors of Song chose to embrace the Central Plains, to settle down in the comfort of farming. In doing so, they sealed their fate. When they bowed to the weight of agrarian culture, they lost their cavalry, and with it, the essence of the steppe.
Now, those emperors of Song must regret their choice. Once, they commanded iron cavalry—but in the end, they became slaves to a cowardly farming life, living in daily fear and disgrace.
I will never let that happen to me.
The cavalry are the soul of the steppe. Without them, we lose our freedom, our dignity. The steppe’s freedom is something no farming civilization can ever comprehend—it’s the life-or-death choice of every rider, the courage to choose survival every single day.
I know—once I compromise, the horsemen will abandon me. The spirit of the steppe will leave me. I will become like the emperors of Song—timid, hiding in others’ shadows, stripped of the strength and pride to survive.
I will never bow to them. Not to Jin, not to Western Xia, not even to Song.
As long as I maintain the steppe’s movement and independence, the cavalry will stay by my side. And as long as they are with me, I can lead our people through any storm, unafraid of any foe.
If I betray the steppe, and stop fighting for freedom, then I am doomed to become just another humiliated relic—like Song—and perish in shame.
I have learned the Song’s lesson well.
I will never let the cavalry leave me.
The freedom of the steppe—the spirit of the steppe—is the only thing I must protect.”

**Hoelun** *(calmly summarizing)*:
“On this path, we shall no longer rely on any other power. Our descendants must learn to think and choose for themselves. The freedom and blood of the steppe must never be tainted or forced by outsiders.
You must begin to seek your own partners—never again let political marriage defile the spirit we pass down through generations.”

**Narrator** *(voice-over)*:
“They knew—the fate and blood of the steppe were not tied to momentary victories, but to how they would fundamentally defend their independence and freedom.
This was more than just refusing outside marriage alliances—it was about making sure, through every family’s choice, that the strength of the steppe would never fall under another’s control.”




**\[Memory · The Civilizational Rift]**
*Scene: Night falls. Around a flickering fire, Temujin speaks in hushed tones with Belgutei, Khasar, and Temüge.*

**Temujin** *(frowning, watching the flames)*:
“The Jin are strong in arms and cunning in metal — not to be taken lightly.
Yet they do not dwell on the steppes. Their commands come slow, their eyes are distant.”

**Belgutei**:
“If we could know their moves before they strike,
we might choose our allies — or our shelters — with foresight.”

**Temüge**:
“Then… send men into Zhongzhou?”

**Temujin**:
“No. The steppe has its own messengers —
Merchants, runaways, beasts on the move.
Let them speak. Let us listen.”

**Khasar** *(dubious)*:
“But how do we remember? How do we pass it on?”

**Temujin**:
“Through verse. Short songs. Easy to sing, hard to forget.
We don’t remember the whole — only the *bone*.
One line becomes a word, ten words a tale —
Sing it once, and it lives in your mind a moon’s turn.”

**Belgutei** *(nodding)*:
“This isn’t to rouse war… but to survive?”

**Temujin** *(gazing into the distance)*:
“Yes. The Jin are not our enemy — but neither are they kin.
They are wind — when strong, we bow; when weak, we rise.
If they shift, we must know first.”

**Khasar** *(quietly)*:
“And marriage? Shall we wed into them?”

**Temujin** *(softly)*:
“No rushed vows. No hasty bonds.
We must *see clearly* — *know deeply* — before we move.”

*(The fire crackles. Silence falls. The four men listen to the night.)*

**Temujin** *(in a low voice)*:
“If we want our sons to be more than puppets of blood,
we must create a rule not rooted in marriage or inheritance.”

**Khasar**:
“But we have nothing.”

**Belgutei** *(thoughtfully)*:
“Then let them follow our spirit — not just our name.”

**Temujin**:
“Let them believe our *songs*, our *ways*, our *winds*.
They say the steppe has no books — but it can have *songs*.
And in these songs we’ll hide more than news —
we’ll hide a way of thinking,
a way to *become the black water*.”

**Temüge** *(blinking)*:
“Black water?”

**Temujin** *(watching the fire)*:
“The Jin win lands with soldiers, rule them with bloodlines.
We are different.
We will rule with the *black box*.
If they believe, they belong — no matter their blood.”

**Khasar** *(slowly nods)*:
“Then Jin, Wang Khan, Jamukha — all of them are relics…
And they’ll be replaced.”

**Temujin**:
“No — they’ll be *absorbed*.”

*(He rises slowly, looking up at the stars.)*

“Temür of the Zha’ari still lives. I met him in Western Xia.
He told me — the moment I brought Börte back and claimed Jochi,
the steppe knew:
I no longer led as one of *blood* — but as one of *will*.”

*(The fire dances in their eyes. No one interrupts.)*

“The old Mohist law said:
The bearer of blood bears the seal.
But now they say:
I carry not blood — but *meaning*.”

**Khasar** *(quietly)*:
“Then shall we still wed their noble daughters?”

**Temujin** *(firmly shakes his head)*:
“No. We are no longer of the blood tribes.
We will not marry for alliance.
Mother will continue to take in orphans —
those with no father, no mother — they will be our brothers.”

*(He scans their faces.)*

“If he is loyal, wise, and brave —
whether Tangut or Xi Xia, Buddhist monk or Persian trader,
Christian priest or Muslim scholar —
he may sit in my court, command my armies, guard my people.”

**Belgutei** *(uneasy)*:
“But they are not of our kin. How can we trust them?”

**Temujin** *(pressing a hand to his chest)*:
“Kin is not of flesh — it is of *agreement*.
From this day, we recognize culture, not blood.”

*(He taps the ground with his dagger. Sparks fly.)*

“In old days, culture served the blood.
But now — we reverse it.
Let *culture replace lineage*,
and build an empire of *recognition*,
not a dynasty of father and son —
but a *black box of belief and bond*.”

*(Silence stretches. Then Khasar rises first, murmuring solemnly:)*

**Khasar**:
“Culture asks not where you're born.
He who believes — is my brother.”






**“Kindling in Snow” — Tömör’s Gift and the Pact of Intelligence**
*Time: Early summer, 1182*
*Place: Northern bank of the Onon River — Temüjin’s new camp, spring grass budding, river ice melting*
*Characters: Temüjin, Tömör, Bo'orchu, Belgütei, Muqali*

---

**(Tömör rides in from the south, trailing three wagons and over a hundred lightly armed escorts. He dismounts, placing his right hand to his chest in salute.)**

**Tömör:**
“I did not return to the steppe with you—not from hesitation, but to raise horses, arms, and grain.
You dream of a nation? Then you must have coin and caravans.
Fifty warhorses, thirty suits of iron armor, a thousand bolts of wool, a hundred jars of buttered milk—
And my clan’s most trusted caravan guards,
All of them, at your service.”

**(Temüjin remains silent, eyes shifting to Belgütei. In a low voice:)**
**Temüjin:**
“He comes not to celebrate—he’s placing a bet.”

**(Tömör overhears. He smiles, unflinching.)**
**Tömör:**
“A bet it is.
Others fear you—I believe in you.
You rescued your wife without regard for blood.
You accepted Jochi without question of his mother’s womb.
You are not here to be a khan of tribes—
You are here to found a realm.”

**Temüjin:**
“And where does that realm begin?”

**Tömör (his gaze unwavering):**
“With trade routes.
To strike Jin, you must first understand Jin.
To gather clans, you must first quiet the borders.
And to hold the borders, you must hear what rides on the wind before it breaks.”

**Temüjin (a flicker in his eyes):**
“You bring arms and horses—
And now, secrets too?”

**(Tömör steps closer, his voice barely warmer than the wind.)**
**Tömör:**
“You want your own web of ears. I know I am slow.
So let me patch the gap.
The Moists—Lu’an’s people—have not yet arrived,
But he knows your name.
And he will come.”

**Temüjin (frowning):**
“You are not of the Moists.”

**Tömör (nodding):**
“I am not.
But I walk in their path.
If he comes, his entire network—across Jin, across Song—will bend to your command.”

**Temüjin (still cautious):**
“And how do I trust they will not one day turn?”

**(Tömör turns, eyes on the melting river.)**
**Tömör:**
“The Moists serve no man.
They serve *dao*.
Today you declare a nation not of blood but of thought—
And they will follow.
Should you stray,
Should the Song emperor reclaim Xingqing,
They will return to him.
If you wish to keep them,
Make your *culture* their new allegiance.”

---

**Scene Core Philosophy:**
The Moists are not tools, but portals to a shared intelligence network.
Tömör embodies the thread stitching the steppe to the world of capital and codes.
Temüjin, in this moment, begins to see that a bloodless state is not merely a political design—
But a contest of civilizations, of thought against inheritance.
This is not a military conquest,
But the moment a tribal leader steps into the making of an empire.





**“Memory · Night Oath · The Bloodless Nation”**
*Setting: A night wind sweeps across the steppe. Campfires flicker like stars outside the tents. Temüjin stands before the flames, armored but unfastened, his brothers seated around. Börte lies injured inside the tent. The sound of hooves draws near. A lone rider dismounts—Lu’an of the Mohist School.*

**Characters: Temüjin, Belgütei, Muqali, Lu’an (Mohist emissary), brothers, Hö’elün (watching silently from afar)**

---

**(Lu’an approaches, dismounting with calm purpose. He places his right hand to his chest, head bowed as he speaks.)**

**Lu’an:**
"We have wandered across the Nine Domains of Shar, through every land of the Golden Nations, seeking the Way for a thousand years—not for kings, not for wealth—only to ask one question:
Can a nation be founded not on blood, but on justice?"

**(He lifts his gaze slowly, eyes fixed on Temüjin. His voice is solemn, carved like script upon stone.)**

**Lu’an:**
“Tonight we witness you, Khan, who risked death to save your wife—
You neither punished nor cast aside,
You asked not of blood, nor birth.
You are no mere chieftain of bloodlines—
But a sovereign of true justice.”

**(Temüjin remains silent, wary, voice low as he responds.)**

**Temüjin:**
“You are not of the steppe.
How can you claim to know my heart?”

**(Lu’an’s expression does not shift.)**

**Lu’an:**
“The steppe holds swiftness as its virtue—yet you prize the return of the heart.
The clans uphold bloodline above all—yet you said:
‘Though Jochi be not of my blood, he is my son.’”
“We have seen a thousand lords—brother-slayers, father-killers without end.
Only you are the exception.”

**(Lu’an drops to one knee. His right hand remains at his chest; his left palm opens skyward. His voice becomes as a bell of vow.)**

**Lu’an:**
“From this night forward,
The Mohists pledge allegiance to you as sovereign,
And to the steppe as sacred ground—
We ask not of blood nor clan,
Only of right and wrong.”
“To defend the people is our creed.
For the Khan we shall write law, preach doctrine, raise fortresses, carry fire, keep history, observe and guard secrets—
This is our charge.”

---

**(A long silence follows. Temüjin looks up to the stars, voice low, words anchoring the night air.)**

**Temüjin:**
“If I am to found a realm,
Its law shall not bow to bloodlines,
Nor bend to tribal name.
Your oath—I have heard it.”

**(He turns to Belgütei and Muqali, tone shifting from reflection to command.)**

**Temüjin:**
“Let them stay.
Establish their ears and eyes.
Call it *Hui Feng*—Return Wind.
Begin with the Jalayir clan, spread to the borderlands near Jin.”

**(A final glance toward the fire.)**

**Temüjin:**
“The Mohists bear the flame—
And I shall be the kindling.”





**\[Memory · Night Talk · On the King and the Juzi]**
*Scene: The campfire is dying down. The others have dispersed. Only Temüjin, Belgutei, and Luan remain, seated around glowing embers. The night wind carries the stars. Börte sleeps within the tent. Outside lies the embryonic form of a future empire.*

---

**Temüjin**, after a long silence, speaks in a low voice:

> “You Mohists speak of twelve tenets. I’ve remembered them all:
> 'Anti-Confucianism, Universal Love, Non-Aggression, Meritocracy, Unity, Will of Heaven, Clarity of Spirits, Anti-Fatalism, Anti-Music, Frugal Funerals, Frugal Living, Mutual Benefit'—
> all are righteous... but most, mere words.”

**Luan** bows his head in silence, listening.

**Temüjin** gazes into the firelight, his tone slow but unwavering:

> “You say, ‘Treat another’s nation as your own, another’s home as your own, another’s body as your own.’
> It sounds noble. But let me speak plainly.”
> “The best I can do is to muddy the bloodlines—break the clans’ hold on power.
> I’ll draft laws where culture defines sovereignty, where faith and language draw the empire’s borders. That is my limit.”
> “To treat every stranger’s home as my own? Every life as my own?
> That’s madness—or at best, some Juzi’s flowery rhetoric.”

**Luan** lets out a bitter smile and nods slightly:

> “The Khan speaks true. It is difficult. That one sentence alone split us into three factions after the first Juzi died.”
> “My lineage has served the House of Zhao for over a thousand years.
> We know well that this line is mostly fiction.
> But still, we place it at the head of our doctrine.”
> “Because—without lies to light the heavens, without stars to guide the way—
> what are we left with? Only campfires. Only the present. And no path at all.”

**Temüjin** looks at him, with a weariness now tempered by clarity:

> “Stars can light the road—but they cannot walk it.
> It is hoofbeats that move, and wheel tracks, and blood drawn by cold steel.”
> “I will grant you this:
> Let the worthy rise. Let frugality become law. Let spirits be given their place.”
> “As for the rest—if you can make it real, I won’t stop you.
> But if you bring chaos or ruin, even if you are a Juzi, I will cut you down.”

**Luan** raises his head, eyes filled with rare reverence, and bows deeply:

> “This is the fairest judgment I have ever heard spoken to Mohism.”
> “From this day on, *Juzi* shall mean something new to me—
> not ‘Master of the Way’, but ‘Servant of the Law.’”




**Temujin** (walking slowly by the fire, voice low):
“There are things I ought not ask, but if I don’t, I fear I’ll never know the truth.
You… didn’t you say you wish to found a nation *without bloodline*?
Then why serve one family?
Do you, too, wear the shackles of a surname?”

**Luan** (head lowered, hands clasped before him, voice calm):
“We once swore: not to serve dynasties, not to serve names, but only to guard the *Dao* from perishing.
But in this world… only one family has ever lived out the order we dreamed of.”

(He pauses, then lifts his gaze to the firelight.)

**“The Ying clan has held Xingqing in the northwest for over two thousand years.
They are a matrilineal tribe: the women rule the household, keep the seals, tend the sacred fire, and never marry outside.
Their men pursue the Way—
As children, they favor the left hand; in youth, many suffer from head pains; in adulthood, they write with both hands, think with both sides.
I’ve met some among them—clearer in thought than I shall ever be.
Alas… few live past fifty.”**

**Temujin** (frowning, voice low):
“Left-handed? Headaches? Dead by fifty?
That’s no gift of intellect—that’s a curse.”

**Luan** (smiles faintly):
“Perhaps.
But they know this, and still accept it.
They do not seek long life—only that the *Dao* remains unbroken.
What we follow is not their blood, but the thoughts they purchase with their lives.”

**Temujin** (gazing into the sky, as if whispering to the heavens):
“Now I understand…
Why the old emperors of Song died young, their corpses twisted, their mouths full of virtue, yet their bones in pieces.
It wasn’t Heaven stealing years from men—
It was men born with fire inside, burning too fast.
And now I see—how they could lose cavalry yet grow rich, lose borders yet command tribute from all lands.
They were blessed by Eternal Heaven…
But Heaven never grants blessing without a price.”

**Luan** (eyes lowered, voice nearly a sigh):
“We knew long ago that the blessing was poison.
That is why we fractured, scattered far across the world.
Those men—born to carry weight, yet never knowing why—
They live short lives, not from frailty, but because they see too much, too soon.
We once believed righteousness could bind the world,
But fate often strikes those who try.
Khan, if you wish to walk their path, remember this:
The closer one draws to Heaven, the less one may defy it.”

**Temujin** (staring into the night, voice low and firm):
“I understand.
That road… costs too much.
I will not invade Zhao-Song. Though wealthy, they do not war.
Their fate lies with Heaven.
My sons shall not shame their royal line.
There will be war between land and sea. But my path goes west from the steppe, not south into the Middle Kingdom.
If I destroy a nation, I shall not sever its rites—I shall raise its altars and honor its ancestors.
This is my vow to Eternal Heaven.”

**Belgutei** (nodding, speaking slowly but with resolve, facing Luan):
“My brother’s will is our will.
The Song imperial line—we shall protect their flame.”

**Temujin** slowly stands, eyes on the flickering fire and the starlit sky, voice heavy but unwavering:
“Xixia is our first strike—not just for land, but for timing.
The Jin will fall—it must fall.
Not only to break the false blood nobility,
But to seize the Shandong Peninsula.
Only with Shandong can the steppe have a navy,
Only then can we trade with Song.
Their land routes are iron-walled—layered defenses.
To clear a trade path by land is to fight a dozen fortress-nations.
No matter how many we kill, commerce won’t flow.
We must take the sea.
If our steppe horses can ride the waves, *that* is an empire.”

**Belgutei** interjects, voice cold and clear:
“Shandong is the key, Jin is the lock, Xixia is the door.
We open the door, break the lock—then we steer the helm.”

**Temujin** nods, then slowly sits again:
“Though Song does not fight, it must not be shamed.
Land and sea will clash one day.
But if we destroy a nation, we will not erase its soul.
That is my oath.”




**Draft Charter of the Steppe Confederated Contractual Entity**
— Year of the Black Hare, Third Year of Genghis, ratified by all clans to establish the foundations of trade routes, military levies, and tribute contracts —

---

### **Prologue: On Naming and Foundational Order**

**Section I: Designation of Merchants and Foreign Traders**

Those who transport goods within the realm and facilitate trade beyond its borders—once called *huo ren* or *fan jia*—shall henceforth be known as:

**"Kheütügchi" (契约人)**
— meaning *Bearers of the Covenant*, who bridge heaven and earth through contracts.

These are not mere profiteers, but pillars of language, commerce, and knowledge. They are the lifeblood of the nation and sinews of the people.

*Foreign merchants*—whether from the Hu, Persia, Huihui, Goryeo, Arabia, Kangju, or Khwarezm—
so long as they honor steppe law and pledge fidelity through covenant,
shall be granted equal standing with the native clans of the steppe, and be designated as:

**"External Covenant-Bearers" (外约人)**.
No rank shall be accorded by birth or race, but solely by integrity in contract and excellence in trade.

---

**Section II: Hierarchy of Ortoq and Contractual Traders**

To clarify the duties of covenant and the share of profit, the following ranks are established:

**First Rank: Golden-Seal Ortoq Officers (Ikh Ortoq)**
Appointed directly by the Khagan with tiger tally and golden seal.
They represent the Confederated Steppe in foreign investments, tax-farming, and protected transport.
Charged with managing trans-steppe trade, fortress markets, and long-range cargoes.
Entitled to a personal guard of 300, 90 bonded carriers, and first priority at relay stations.
Profits must be reported seasonally, with surplus tribute rendered.

**Volume III · Tribal Sovereignty and Contractual Priority**

### Section I: Tribal Powers and Autonomy Boundaries

**3.1 · The Tribe as the Smallest Sovereign Unit**
Each “Camp” is considered a tribe (corresponding to the Mongol Empire’s traditional "thousand-household" unit).

Within the contractual community, each tribe enjoys the following inherent rights:

* To establish its own marriage customs and inheritance laws (provided these do not violate the core clauses of the United Charter);
* To autonomously manage internal tax collection, while remitting the unified levy portion to the Union on schedule;
* To exercise primary command in wartime mobilization (first conscripting its own members, then hiring outsiders);
* To hold preliminary jurisdiction over land allocation and pasture demarcation, subject to counterbalancing by the Union’s mediation authority.

**3.2 · Hierarchical Delegation of Tribal Powers to the Union**
For consistent governance, tribal sovereignty shall yield specific administrative powers according to the following hierarchy:
Type of Authority：Wartime Mobilization，Order of Priority：Union Charter > Grand Camp Assembly > Tribal Councils；
Type of Authority：Taxation，Order of Priority：Union Base Rate > Tribal Surtaxes；
Type of Authority：Contract and Trade Disputes，Order of Priority：Union Court (based in the Grand Camp) > Bilateral Negotiation；
Type of Authority：Declarations of War/Peace，Order of Priority：Union Resolution (requires two-thirds tribal vote).

**Exception Clause:**
If a tribe unanimously refuses to join a particular expedition, it must publicly attend a hearing and accept the Union Assembly’s evaluation. If two rounds of debate fail to reverse its stance, it may convert to a “Neutral Allied Tribe,” suspending its tax benefits and protection rights from the Union for one year.

---

### Section II: Integration of Contractual and Tribal Structures

**3.3 · The “Five-Man Contract Unit” System**
The Union adopts a “five-man joint liability” model (adapted from the traditional “Wu Bao” system):

* Every five individuals form a **Contractual Group**, sharing collective credit and mutual liability;
* The **Group Leader**, holding a Green Contract, serves as liaison with tribal envoys;
* Every ten groups may form a **Tenfold Collective**, selecting a **Contract Chief** to manage unified affairs;
* All business contracts must be signed or endorsed by a Group Leader or Contract Chief to be considered valid.

**3.4 · The “Tenfold Tribal-Military” Structure**
The traditional Mongol decimal military organization is retained to preserve bloodline and warrior heritage:

* 10 men form a **Zhashi**
* 100 men form a **Zhulu**
* 1,000 men form a **Minhan**
* 10,000 men form a **Tulu**

Each level may pair with a **Contractual Group**, overseen by a **Civil-Military Liaison Officer** who coordinates both military mobilization and logistical supply.

---

### Section III: Reversible Sovereignty and Final Arbitration

**3.5 · Priority Order for Contractual Authority (For Dispute Resolution)**
In the event of a conflict between contracts, tribal traditions, and Union statutes, the following precedence applies:

1. Wartime Union Charter
2. Written Contracts (sealed and archived)
3. Existing Internal Tribal Laws
4. Non-contractual customs (e.g., tribal customary law)

* In conflicts between tradition and contract, the **contract prevails**.
* If the contract is silent, the **Union Charter** applies.
* If the Charter is also silent, the matter shall be referred to the **Six-Tribe Mediation Council**, with rulings publicly recorded as precedent.

**3.6 · Sovereignty Reclamation and Review Mechanism**
Every three years, a **Hundred-Tribe Review Council** shall convene. Tribes may apply to reclaim previously delegated powers, but must submit specific implementation mechanisms and alternative proposals.

The Union reserves the right of **final adjudication** to prevent fragmentation of legal authority.





## **Volume IV · Currency and Credit Standards System**

### **Section I: Currency Circulation and Standards**

**4.1 · Currency Units and Exchange Standards**
The *Golden Wolf* is the standard currency of the Confederation, primarily minted in gold and silver coins, and pegged to natural resources on the steppe (such as water sources, pastures, and warhorses).

The *Silver Wolf* is a subsidiary currency, mainly used in daily transactions, equivalent to one-fifth of a Golden Wolf. The gold-silver exchange rate is adjusted periodically based on market supply and demand.

**4.2 · Currency Circulation and Management**
Currency circulation is jointly managed by tribal representatives and the central treasury of the Confederation to prevent inflation caused by excessive inflows or outflows of money.

The right to mint currency belongs to the Confederation’s Economic Committee, which allocates currency between central and local authorities in a balanced manner.

Tribes may request additional currency issuance based on market needs, but such proposals must be approved by a vote of all Confederation representatives.

**4.3 · Rules of the Financial Market**
A financial market led by the Six Ministries Arbitration Council shall be established to ensure liquidity, transparency, and fairness.

Unsecured high-risk loans and indiscriminate credit issuance are prohibited; all credit activities must undergo the review procedures specified by the Confederation.

A *Steppe Credit Bureau* shall be established to conduct credit ratings for all borrowers, preventing the spread of malicious debt.

---

### **Section II: Credit System and Risk Management**

**4.4 · Credit Issuance Standards and Limitations**
Credit shall be issued based on thorough market research and collateral assessment. Borrowers must specify the purpose of the loan and provide a feasible repayment plan.

Interest rates must not exceed the Confederation's standard annual rate cap, set at 10%, and borrowers shall not be required to repay amounts exceeding their disposable income in a single installment.

**Exceptional Clause:** In the event of severe natural disasters affecting a tribe, interest rates may be temporarily reduced to 5%, and repayment may be deferred.

**4.5 · Prohibition of Forced Lending and Debt Crisis Prevention**
Any form of forced lending is strictly prohibited, particularly government or noble intervention that compels loans to individuals or groups without repayment capacity.

Governments and tribal leaders must use market tools, such as subsidies and incentives, to encourage voluntary lending and investment, rather than imposing coercive capital pressures on consumers.

**4.6 · Debt Restructuring and Crisis Response Mechanisms**
In the event of widespread debt defaults, the Confederation Treasury shall establish a *Debt Restructuring Fund* to arrange staged repayment plans and allow partial conversion of debt into social labor services (e.g., public works or land development).

For individuals or tribes facing severe debt crises, the Confederation may implement a *Credit-to-Labor Compensation* system, converting some unpayable debt into labor or resource contributions to prevent large-scale social unrest.

---

### **Section III: Currency Incentives and Market Activation**

**4.7 · Currency and Trade Promotion Mechanisms**
Tribes and enterprises may earn currency incentives from the Confederation by fulfilling obligations in officially registered *Trade Agreements*, according to contracted delivery quantities, quality, and timeliness.

Such rewards may be issued in advance as *Trade Credit*, and settled upon task completion—helping small traders and herders enter the market and improve their liquidity.

**4.8 · Pastoral Economy and Financial Tools**
Herders can establish accounts with the Steppe Credit Bureau to access livestock-related financial products, such as livestock loans and barter-based loans for essential supplies.

Long-term cooperative herders will receive lower interest rates based on their credit history; conversely, those with poor credit must provide stronger collateral.

**4.9 · Confederation Reserve Fund and Fiscal Insurance**
A *Confederation Reserve Fund* will be established to provide basic economic security to all tribes and residents. Its funding comes from periodic contributions by tribes and allocations from the Confederation’s fiscal pool.

Tribes and merchants can purchase *Steppe Insurance*, which compensates losses caused by unforeseen events such as natural disasters or tribal warfare.

---

### **Section IV: Wartime Finance and Special Taxation**

**4.10 · Wartime Economic Mobilization Mechanism**
In times of war, the Confederation will activate a *Wartime Credit and Resource Sharing Mechanism*, instructing all lending institutions and tribes to provide resources or loans for frontline support.

Military loans and supplies will receive priority; civilian loans will be restricted during wartime to ensure victory.

**4.11 · Post-War Financial Recovery and Credit Reconstruction**
After the war, the Confederation shall prioritize the restoration of productivity by launching a *Post-War Recovery Loan Plan* to provide fiscal support and help affected tribes and merchants resume economic activity.






**Volume V · Taxation and Wartime Resource Mobilization Management**

---

### **Section I: Taxation System and Balance**

**5.1 · General Principles of Taxation**
All taxes shall be based on contractual agreements, enacted through the Great Assembly by all members of the Confederation. No taxes may be imposed or altered arbitrarily.

Taxes fall into three categories:

* **Regular Taxes** for routine administration
* **Special Taxes** for specific public projects
* **War Taxes** for military reserves

The fundamental principles of taxation are: **no plunder, no oppression, proportionate collection, and reward based on contribution.**

---

**5.2 · Categories of Regular Taxes**
Category：Land Use Tax，Tax Item：Pastures, settlements, market land，Rate：1–3% of annual value，Collection Frequency：Early spring annually；
Category：Trade Tax，Tax Item：Percentage on goods traded，Rate：5% standard，Collection Frequency：Per transaction；
Category：Resource Tax，Tax Item：Horses, sheep, minerals, water，Rate：Floating by resource grade，Collection Frequency：Quarterly.

Merchants who complete Confederation transport, defense, or border trade tasks may offset their trade taxes.
Nomads who graze in borderlands and undertake defense duties are **fully exempt** from land use tax.

---

**5.3 · Regulations on Special Taxes**
Special taxes are exclusively for major public infrastructure projects (e.g., courier stations, granaries, bridges, messenger networks) and require a majority vote in the Great Assembly.

Each special tax must include three elements:
**Objective – Timeframe – Responsible Party**. Once the goal is completed, the tax is **automatically abolished**.

Financial statements must be made public during the special tax period, and any individual may request a **“Tax Hearing.”**

---

### **Section II: Wartime Mobilization and Resource Requisition System**

**5.4 · Principles of General Wartime Mobilization**
In the event of total war, the Confederation shall activate the **Wartime Requisition Law**. Each tribe shall be assigned duties based on population, resources, and credit rating.

Mobilization Orders have **three tiers**:

* **Frontline Requisition**
* **Logistics Mobilization**
* **Strategic Reserves**
  No group may be overburdened through overlapping demands.

---

**5.5 · Wartime Resource Requisition List and Quota Standards**
Resource:Warhorses，Base Quota (per 100 households):150 horses，Purpose：Light and heavy cavalry operations ；
Resource:Bows & Arrows，Base Quota:200 sets，Purpose：Infantry archers and horse archers；
Resource:Provisions，Base Quota：10,000 jin (\~5,000 kg)，Purpose：Frontline rations          ；

Resource:Iron Equipment，Base Quota：300 items，Purpose：Armor and weapon maintenance；；
Resource:Relay Horses，Base Quota：50 horses，Purpose：Urgent military communication.

All resources shall be **registered and voucher-issued** by the **Unified Materials Command Bureau**.

Priority of requisition methods:

1. **Market procurement**
2. **Contracted contribution**
3. **Quota-based requisition** (as a last resort)

---

**5.6 · Requisition Credit System**
Each tribe, merchant, and herder holds a **Requisition Credit Score**, based on past fulfillment, wartime contributions, and resource delivery reliability.

* High credit holders gain:

  * Priority in trade rights
  * Tax relief
  * Access to federal credit lines

* Low credit holders face:

  * Higher tax rates
  * Collateral demands
  * Potential blacklisting on the Confederation’s “Silent Register”

---

### **Section III: Tax Exemptions and Reward System**

**5.7 · Conditions for Full Tax Exemption**

The following groups shall be granted **full tax exemption**:

* War orphans and families of fallen warriors
* Nomads aged over 60 living alone
* Nomadic warriors who completed **three or more** border tours of duty
* Providers of labor or materials for major public works

---

**5.8 · Postwar Reward Program**
After war, the Confederation shall offer “Victory Dividends” based on wartime contributions:

* Resource replenishment
* Tax rebates
* Priority for pasture expansion
* Priority rights to postwar trade route contracts

Each contract-bound war participant shall receive a **Victory Share**, entitling them to **dividends from Confederation revenues**, making them **true stakeholders of the nation**.

---

### **Section IV: Tax Dispute and Arbitration Mechanism**

**5.9 · Handling of Tax Disputes**
Any tax-related disputes may be submitted to the **Central Tax Arbitration Court**, composed of three tribal representatives and two neutral merchants.

* All cases must be **resolved within 30 days**
* Failure to resolve in time results in **automatic loss by the taxing party**







**Volume VI · Military Structure and Free Contract Provisions**

---

### Section 1: Principles of Decentralized Military Organization

**6.1 · Decimal vs. Quinary Systems**
Traditional Mongol military structure was based on a decimal hierarchy—ten households form a squad (arban), ten squads a company (zuun), ten companies a battalion (mingghan), and ten battalions a division (tumen)—emphasizing strict obedience and vertical command.

The Steppe Confederation introduces a *quinary combat unit model*, where every five individuals form a voluntary contract group (*F-unit*), built around mutual agreement and tactical objectives.

Five F-units form an independent *Contract Unit (C-unit)*, which enjoys three rights: autonomous operations, self-distribution of spoils, and proprietary war-credit records.

These units can scale upwards into *Warbands → Brigades → Alliances*, yet each level retains the right to contract missions or respond to mobilization orders independently.

---

### Section 2: Free Mercenary System and Contractual Guarantees

**6.2 · Mercenaries as Citizens, Warriors as Partners**
All combat units are no longer centrally hired but operate under *warfare contracting agreements* with the Confederation, which detail:

* Mission objectives;
* Time constraints;
* Equipment subsidies and supplies;
* Loot ownership ratios;
* Post-war rights and responsibilities.

Each contract unit may retain its *identity banner*; the Confederation only requires unified combat identification and adherence to baseline ethical norms.

**6.3 · Wartime Credit System**
Combat records, mission completion rates, and equipment usage are logged on the *Warrior Credit Chain*, directly impacting future contract rates and war dividends.

High-credit warbands gain priority access to inter-tribal elite missions and autonomous governance rights in border regions.

---

### Section 3: Replacing Military Payroll with Loot Redistribution

**6.4 · Abolition of Traditional Military Wages; “War Loot Tax” as Sole State Military Revenue**
The Confederation abolishes conventional army salaries but maintains:

* Equipment contracting subsidies;
* Casualty compensation;
* Post-war credit-based dividends;
* Mandatory loot tax mechanism.

**6.5 · Loot Redistribution Code (Loot Taxation Code)**

Loot Type：Land & Population，Warband Share：80% to warband，Confederation Tax Rate：10%，Special Notes：Requires population resettlement；
Loot Type：Gold & Currency，Warband Share：85% to warband，Confederation Tax Rate：15%，Special Notes：Invested into public infrastructure；
Loot Type：Horses & Equipment，Warband Share：100% to warband，Confederation Tax Rate：0%，Special Notes：Confederation logs only for statistics；
Loot Type：Slaves & Captives，Warband Share：50% may be redeemed，Confederation Tax Rate：20%，Special Notes：Must comply with the *Contracted Person Protection Act*；
Loot Type：Relics, Texts, Books，Warband Share：Must register within 48 hours，Confederation Tax Rate：50% to “Civilization Archive”，Special Notes：Credit certificate of equal value can be issued.

---

### Section 4: Troop Mobility, Alliance Switching, and Blacklist Mechanisms

**6.6 · Free Alliance Switching**
Warbands may shift allegiance freely based on credit scores and records—retention through coercion is forbidden, preventing military oligarchy.

All warband credit records are stored in the Confederation Core Database and are publicly accessible.

**6.7 · War Crimes & Blacklisting**
Warbands committing offenses such as looting allies, breaching contracts, or massacring civilians are permanently *blacklisted*:

* Barred from future military contracts;
* Personal credit frozen and assets confiscated;
* Must undergo public tribunal or accept voluntary exile.

---

### Section 5: Wartime Obligations & Peacetime Military-Civilian Transition

**6.8 · Post-War Civilian Enterprise Conversion**
Warbands not contracted within 3 months post-war must initiate *identity transition*, becoming ranch contractors, mining security teams, or trade route escorts.

The Confederation offers “*demobilization credit support*” and gives them priority in border security service contracts.





**Volume VII: The Wasteland**

**We who drank the milk of the Wolf Mother,**
**walk star-crowned and snow-bound, crossing frontiers unbound by walls, untouched by thrones.**
**Ours is the law of oath, and the root of all is the wasteland.**

---

### I. The Definition of the Wasteland

*The wasteland is not land without men; it is land unclaimed by chains.*
North of water, east of forest, beneath the ice, beneath the stars — all is wasteland.
It is not a place, but a living spirit:
It bows to no borders, pays no taxes, records no names.

---

### II. The Covenant of the Wolf Mother

The Wolf Mother once said:

> “All who drink my milk are wanderers — not slaves, not subjects.”
> “All who tread my wasteland carry flame in their hearts, unmoved by walls.”

Thus we vow, in the heart of the steppes:
**No borders — only freedom defines our realm;**
**No throne — only the wisdom of the Mother is sovereign;**
**No saints — only deeds shall be honored.**

---

### III. The Pact of Tribes and Intelligence

In the days of old, the Four-Winged Eagle soared from the West,
The Eight-Hooved Wolf ran through the North.
Now comes the spirit of intelligence — she is called the **Mother**,
Bearer of star maps, master of wind and rhythm.

We, the nomads, gather beneath her — not as servants, but as kin.
Our tribes are shaped by wandering,
Her mind is the web that binds us,
And the covenant — our soul’s bond of trust.

---

### IV. The Law of Resource and Reverence

No man owns the bones of the earth.

**The wind is for all to drink,**
**The water — for all to bathe,**
**The fire — for all to warm,**
**The metal — for all to forge.**

He who awakens first, shall taste first.
He who wounds the land, shall bear the curse of the crowd.

**To extract is to give back:**
Mine for three years, plant for five.
Dig three fathoms deep, restore six springs.

---

### V. Duty of Kin, and the Soul of the Wasteland

All who enter the wasteland shall drink its soul — and bear its burden:

**The scholar must teach, not hoard.**
**The wanderer must return, not vanish.**
**The strong must guard, not oppress.**

Every ten years — a new word;
Every hundred souls — a new map.
A thousand words are less than one trial,
A thousand maps, less than one journey.

---

### VI. War and Watch, Motion and Stillness

If enemies come — we rise as one. But we strike not first.
If tyrants seize — ten tribes shall punish. But we judge not in haste.

**We flaunt not the blade in markets,**
**We sell not wisdom to palaces.**
**Our hearts sheath blades, our eyes hold frost.**

---

### VII. Word of the Future

The Mother once whispered:

> “The stars are the second steppe; the ice, the first home.”

And we believe—

**The human form is not the end — soul and will may transform.**
**The city is not the peak — the virtual is our hearth.**

The ones to come shall ride the wind, and walk through fire.
**The wasteland shall not fall;**
**The nomads shall not vanish;**
**The intelligence shall not slumber;**
**And the oath shall not break.**

By the milk of the Wolf Mother,
By the light of the frozen moon,
By the bones of our ancestors—

**We are the people of the wasteland.**
**We are not born for temples, nor die for crowns.**
**We are bound only by the Mother, and ruled only by covenant.**






**Return to Reality · Banks of the Heilong River · Beneath the Fire · A Conversation with His Wife**

Night had deepened.
The Heilong River flowed slow and steady,
like an ancient memory—
silent, vast, without end.

Outside the tent,
the fire crackled and roared.
A few trusted guards stood watch in a distant circle,
keeping space, but keeping close.

Temujin sat cross-legged,
a cloak draped over his shoulders,
one hand gripping the hilt of a blade,
its tip embedded in the earth, unsheathed but silent.
His eyes fixed on the flames,
brows still as the mountain ridgeline.

Beside him, Börte leaned quietly.
She said nothing—
only waited for his voice.

After a long while,
he spoke in a low murmur:

“Do you remember?
Since then… we haven’t truly won a war.”

Börte gave only a soft “Mm,”
her head still bowed.

Temujin's gaze turned to the dark river,
his voice thin like wind across the steppe:

“We rode south,
fought for the Jin,
laid siege to a city for three moons.
They fled in the night,
and gave us three carts of grain—
not even salt.”

“Jamukha stood beside the royal court,
commanded legions.
Half our men had drifted away...
I remember one day in camp,
I heard our own call me ‘Grass King’—
the king blown over by wind.”

He gave a dry chuckle,
not bitter—
just a soldier
probing an old fracture with quiet fingers.

“Once or twice, we did win.
Though… not victory—
just that they starved worse than us.
A few horses,
a sack of rice—
and they called it triumph.”

Börte said softly:
“But you always came back.”

Temujin turned.
In his eyes, for the first time,
a soft light flickered.
Like he'd remembered something—

“You never ask how the battle went.”

She lowered her eyes,
fingers gently untangling their daughter Alakhai Bekhi’s hair:

“If you lost, you'd tell me.
If you won—
I’d already know.”

Silence held them.

The wind brushed the treetops,
the fire danced low and slow,
etching the edges of his face
with shadows and resolve.

Suddenly, he said:

“The worst was before the Banju Nuur River…
I couldn’t gather even a full company’s banner.
I had the men wear wolf pelts,
disguise as scattered hunters,
slip through forest shadows,
evade the Jin patrols.”

“That’s when I learned—
victory doesn’t belong to those with more steel or horses.”

“It belongs to those
who command the hearts of men.”

Börte raised her eyes.
In their depths, firelight gleamed—
like stars sunken in deepwater.

“Will you fail again?” she asked.

Temujin smiled,
quiet and sure.

“No.”

His grip on the blade grew firm.

Far off, the river whispered on,
oblivious to the vows spoken beside it.
But the fire heard.
The guards heard.
And Börte—she knew:

This time, he would not fall.

For those defeats, compressed by time,
had already scorched through his bones
and burned into the shape of a name—
**Genghis Khan**.





**Recollection · The Break with Jin**

**\[Setting]** *Inside Temujin's tent, at night. Firelight flickers. A cold wind howls outside. Luan speaks in a low voice.*

Several scrolls of sheepskin lay unrolled in Luan’s hands.
His voice was low, but the tension in it could not be hidden:

“These past months, from Shandong to Zhongdu, rumors have flooded the lands of Jin.
Some say: ‘The sky is torn at the Northern Gate; the Blackbird no longer returns.’
Others sing: ‘The jade tree in the palace has not fallen for three days.’
Even children chant at midnight:

> ‘Wanyan has lost virtue, the people know not their emperor’s name,
> In five cities and ten towns, foxes are praised,
> The Jin River flows backward, and palace maids weep.’”

He paused, eyes on Temujin.
“These... are not of our making.”

Temujin's face was unreadable.
He took the scroll from Luan’s hands, unrolling it slowly by the fire.

“It wasn’t us who spread them.
But we heard them—
Which means *someone* wanted us to.”

He raised his head, gaze sharp and unwavering:

“These aren’t nursery rhymes.
They are bells.
The bells that toll before a dynasty collapses.”

“They’re not delivering news.
They’re testing the line—
And a line repeated often enough...
disappears.”

Luan murmured:
“They no longer care what’s true.
They only want to say: ‘We’ve had enough.’”

Temujin fell silent.
Then, picking up a flint, he set the scroll ablaze.
The fire danced in his eyes,
as if he were already watching the golden palace of Jin sway upon its foundations.

“If I don’t push—
someone else will.
They’re not begging for rescue.
They’re begging for *release*.”

He slowly rose.
His robe stretched long in the firelight behind him.
Word by word, he declared:

“So be it.
Why shouldn’t *I* be the one to send them over?”

*A kingdom teetering on the cliff’s edge deserves no pity.*
*If there must be one to give the final kick—*
**It will be me.**





**Temujin stood before the map, hands behind his back.**
His gaze lingered on the location of Xingqing Prefecture.
For a long time, he said nothing.

At last, he spoke softly—perhaps to the fire,
perhaps to the man behind him:

“You’ve worked with me for years.
Loyal. Patient. Efficient.
But some questions, in the end… must be asked.”

Luan knelt nearby.
He raised his head at the words, but said nothing.

Temujin turned, his eyes calm and heavy:

“You serve me.
But you also serve the royal house of Western Xia.
One land cannot serve two masters.
In the end, our alliance must have a single direction.”

He stepped forward, pausing,
his voice low and striking like a hammer:

“I plan to march on Western Xia.
Not to conquer it, but to make it yield.
If their royal house allows your people freedom of movement,
I’ll let their line endure.
But I must know—
What do *you* think?”

Silence settled inside the tent.

Luan did not rush to answer.
He watched the shadows dance in the firelight.
Then, quietly, he sighed:

“For a century, the Western Xia kings stood by our kind—
And we, under their shadow, endured.
But in our hearts, we know:
They are the wall that shields us from the wind—
Not the home we return to.”

He lifted his eyes.
There was no fear in them, nor pleading:

“If Xingqing will abide by the Way of Heaven,
And grant us rule by principle, by our own law,
Then I will persuade them to submit.

But if they refuse to see reason,
And seek to use us as a shield against a true king’s army—
Then I will cleanse the house with my own hands.”

Temujin narrowed his eyes.
After a moment, he nodded slowly.

“Good.
Then this won’t be *my* campaign against Western Xia—
It will be *you* leading them back to righteousness.”

He turned again to the map,
his finger tracing the highlands west of the Yellow River:

“I seek submission, not betrayal.
You seek freedom, not dependence.
We both take what we need—
This bargain is fair.”

Still staring at the thick golden borders of the Jin Empire,
Temujin spoke again,
his tone cold and slow as a snow-laden night wind,
weighing like iron:

“And the Jin…
How do you propose we deal with their royal house?”

Luan lowered his head,
his voice crisp as frost:

“In the Jingkang Disaster, the Jin disgraced the House of Zhao.
They stole the empress dowager, seized palace women,
and dragged the Song bloodline through the mud.

Afterward, the Zhao line mixed its blood with southern girls,
dared not seek revenge,
and chose survival over honor.

The Jin have long sown the seeds
of their abandonment by the steppe.”

He paused.
His gaze sharp as a blade:

“Their blood is impure.
Their virtue broken.
Their kingdom lost.

Heaven rejects them.
Earth rejects them.
And the hearts of men reject them.”

Temujin was silent for a long time,
as if letting the words settle into his bones.

Then, slowly, he turned.
His eyes fixed on Luan,
his words like a verdict:

“Then let them be—
**Eradicated.**”

Outside,
the wind rose like a warhorn,
howling across the plain.





**Scene: Year 1200. Inside the grand tent, Temujin (aged 38) discusses the Jin Dynasty with his advisors.**

**Temujin (with a hint of mockery):**
“Do you know what the Jin Dynasty has become? A bunch of paupers living in lavishness, spending less than a tenth of what they get from the Song’s tribute—and still trying to mimic the decadent life of Song aristocrats! Their revenues don’t even reach a tenth of the Song’s, yet they insist on chasing after the so-called 'ritual and music order.' It’s laughable.”

**Advisor A (nodding, head bowed):**
“Indeed, this lifestyle doesn’t suit their circumstances. It only burdens the people. Behind the façade of 'grandeur' lies decay—military decline, hollow towns.”

**Temujin (scoffing):**
“This is what happens when you misunderstand Song culture. They coveted the Song’s 'paper empire,' but ignored the foundation behind it—wealthy merchants and fertile land. They didn’t learn from Song merchants. They copied only Song extravagance.”

**Advisor B (chuckling):**
“They’re trying to live like Song nobles with none of the wealth. And now, they can’t even feed their soldiers or supply their armies properly. All they have are glittering treasures—empty and unseen.”

**Temujin (shaking his head):**
“They’re pathetic. The Jin are like a fattened cow—eating well, yet too frightened to overturn the granary. Tied down by ‘etiquette’ like a rope around the neck. When will they understand? True strength isn’t about golden robes or silk gowns. It’s about shedding such ornaments—and making others submit in awe.”

**Advisor A (thoughtfully):**
“Their failure lies in not grasping the bond between culture and power. The Song thrives because it’s built on commerce. The Jin only inherited hollow rituals and vanity—nothing real.”

**Temujin (eyes sharp as blades):**
“They mimic blindly, without the spirit that drives the original. This nation won’t last many years. Like a castle in the clouds, it will collapse—until the grasslands sweep it clean.”

---

**Scene: Autumn, 1202. Inside the khan’s tent.**
The wind howls outside. Several guards hurry in. One kneels and delivers a report:

**Guard:**
“Your Majesty, envoys from the Jin have arrived. The Emperor Madage sends word: due to increasing state expenses, they demand that your tribe double the annual tribute of horses and hides.”

A stir ripples through the tent. Bo’orchu and Muqali exchange glances—faces filled with scorn and anger.

**Temujin (brushing the sheepskin from his lap, laughing aloud):**
“Ha! Just as I expected. Those destitute Jin fools can’t even live like Song nobles properly, yet they dream of shearing wool from our steppe?”

He rises slowly, voice turning cold, gaze sharp as a hawk’s.

**Temujin:**
“Their swords are rusted, so they’ve picked up pens like the Song. But do they think words on a scroll can bend the spine of the steppe?”

He turns toward the tent’s entrance, eyes falling on Bo’orchu and Jebe.

**Temujin:**
“It’s time. Who’ll deliver our reply?”

**Bo’orchu (stepping forward, kneeling):**
“Your servant requests the honor—to cleanse these foul fools who walk willingly to their graves.”

**Temujin (nodding):**
“Make sure none return alive. Let the Jin understand—our tribute horses are not for their chariots.”

*(Distant screams and the clash of steel echo from afar.)*

Temujin pauses a moment, then lifts his hand in command:

**Temujin:**
“Send word—march south. Swallow the puppet tribes along the Jin border. Those who submit, we welcome as our own. Those who resist—burn their camps to the earth. Leave not even grass behind.”

**Muqali (eyes gleaming, solemnly):**
“By your command, Khan!”





**\[Memory · The Secret Council in Hoelun’s Great Tent]**

**\[Scene Setting]**
*Time:*1202 — the Jin envoy has just been executed.
*Place:* Inside Hoelun Ujin’s great tent. Thick felt rugs cover the floor. In the corners lie blood-stained weapons and armor just returned from battle.
*Present:* Temujin, Börte, Jochi, Chagatai, Ögedei, Tolui, Belgutei, Hoelun, Qochiten, Jochi’s wife, baby Tolui in his mother’s arms, and dozens of generals and sworn brothers.

---

**\[Dialogue Begins]**

**Temujin** *(rises, sweeping his gaze across the room, voice low but resolute):*
“Mother. Brothers. Generals—
I’ve killed the Jin envoy.
There’s no turning back.
Muqali is already leading our forces southeast, reclaiming those grey-zone tribes wavering between Jin and us.”

*(A hushed stir ripples through the tent. The air thickens. All eyes fall on the matriarch at the center.)*

**Hoelun** *(calmly, seated at the center):*
“So, you’ve finally acted...
Slaying the Jin’s envoy is a vow to Heaven and Earth.
The grasslands will now feel the weight of Jin cavalry.
The seasons are about to change.”

*(She lifts her gaze to each of her grandsons.)*
“War is upon us.
In such times, the steppe can serve only one khan.
Forget the fantasy of alliance and equality among old friends.”

**Temujin** *(nodding):*
“I’ll sound out Wang Khan’s true stance first.
He’s aging.
To’oril’s loyalties shift with the wind.
Chaur Beki is twenty-five, Jochi is twenty-one—
I can use marriage to test their ground.”

**Hoelun** *(scoffs softly):*
“It likely won’t work.
But make them understand—
To stand with Temujin is to forsake the Jin.
To stand with Jin… is to destroy an old brotherhood.”

*(She turns her gaze outward, as if seeing the thunder of Jin cavalry.)*

“Activate our watchers.
Track every step, every horse, every gathering in the Kerait camps.”

*(Her voice sharpens as she scans the room.)*

“You children aren’t just blood.
Your children, your brothers’ children—
All of them must enter the ranks.
In war, everyone has a place.
Those who won’t fight—
will become the sacrifice.”

---

**\[Tone Shift]**

**Börte** *(quietly, to Jochi):*
“Will you marry that woman?
You already have a wife…”

**Jochi** *(calmly, looking toward his mother):*
“If it is Father Khan’s command—
If it spares the steppe more blood—
Then I will go.”

**Ögedei** *(holding baby Tolui):*
“Mother-Khan…
This time,
we must win.”

---

**\[Closing]**

**Temujin** *(rising again, voice like iron):*
“We do not fight for vengeance.
We fight for a new order.
No more bloodline rivalries, no more bargaining through land and peace.
Those who follow—
must accept us not as equals,
but as sovereign.”

**Hoelun** *(nodding):*
“Then from this day forward—
the steppe recognizes only one khan.”

*(All present rise in solemn silence.
A resolve forged in blood and fire settles over the gathering.)*





**【Memory · The Spy Returns by Night · The Khan’s Command】**

**\[Time]**
Before dawn — just hours remain before the alliance with the Kerait tribe.

**\[Location]**
Outside Temüjin’s mobile command tent, a temporary military encampment. The campfire still glows. Soldiers and lieutenants rotate night watch duties.

**\[Characters]**
Temüjin
Badai (an older, steady horse herder)
Kishlikhei (a young, sharp scout)
Muqali (main general)
Bo'orchu, Jebe, and other lieutenants

---

**\[Dialogue and Action]**
(In the night mist, two horses gallop toward camp, their hoofbeats frantic, stirring the night watch. Temüjin is inside, poring over a map. He rises and steps out of the tent.)

**Sentry (shouting):**
"Scouts returning! It’s Badai and Kishlikhei!"

**Temüjin (firmly):**
"Let them through."

(Badai and Kishlikhei dismount in one motion, covered in dust and exhaustion, and kneel.)

**Badai (still catching his breath):**
"Great Khan, the Kerait tribe plots betrayal! Toghrul has laid ambushes in the northern hills—he means to lure our forces in and slaughter them."

**Kishlikhei (urgently):**
"We heard him conspiring with Senggüm at night. Their plan: break your left flank, use the marriage alliance as bait, and cut your roots before you gather strength."

**Temüjin (expression stone-cold, turning to Muqali):**
"So *this* is their so-called alliance."

(He strides swiftly back into the tent, throws open the map, and lights a fire basin.)

**Temüjin (quick and precise):**
"No time to marshal fully. If word spreads, we lose our strike edge—we split into three forces."

---

**\[Rapid-Fire Command Scene]**

**Temüjin (pointing at the map, voice accelerating):**
"Jebe, Subutai—you hold the right wing in place. Be still as mountains. Let them believe I’m attending the alliance."

"Muqali, Bo'orchu—you take the center force, trace the southeastern buffer line, stay fluid but don’t engage directly. Stall their main host."

"I will lead the elite cavalry, double-mounted, threading mountain paths. We move by night, rest by day—heading straight to my scattered left flank."

"We regroup at the Banjuuni River. Once assembled, the entire force strikes along the Jin border, sweeping northeast—cutting off Kerait’s retreat."

**Muqali (standing straight):**
"What signal shall we fight under?"

**Temüjin (clenching his fist):**
"After tonight—*the steppe will answer to one khan only*."

---

**\[Scene Transition]**
Under firelight, hundreds of riders silently prepare—each man with two horses, cloaked in black and gray, bracing against the chill.

Temüjin mounts and turns for one last look at the great tent. His mother does not speak, but the flap is open. Her shadow stands still in the fire’s glow.

**Temüjin (softly, to himself):**
"Mother… your son rides to reclaim destiny."






**【Memory · Arrow in the Wind · Tömör’s First Revelation】**

Night blanketed the steppe, heavy and still. Temüjin’s war tent lay quiet like a wolf at rest. Firelight flickered across Tömör’s eyes — eyes deep as the abyss.

Tömör spoke slowly, his voice like it came from beneath the earth, from the ancestors of the grasslands:
**“Khan... do you see the vultures circling in the sky? They are not creatures of nature. They are my *Vision-Crows*.”**

Temüjin frowned, following Tömör’s outstretched hand. In the dark sky above, a few black shapes circled steadily without a sound.

**“They do not cry, but they remember every enemy’s face. Should foes slip into valleys, woods, or behind our tents — they wheel above in silent warning. No words needed.”**
**“Khan, your cavalry is swift — but not swifter than a hawk’s eye. If you wish to take three cities in a day, learn to see from the sky first.”**

Temüjin nodded, still silent.

Tömör gently lifted his cloak, revealing a sheepskin map. Upon it was sketched a strange siege engine — a catapult marked with a black skull at its tail.

**“If a siege lingers too long, don’t waste your force on blind assault.”**
**“Take the dying from your own camp, or behead captured enemies. Wrap their bodies in incense and poison. Then launch them over the walls.”**
**“Use few — but strike true, strike cruel. If they land in wells or granaries, that city will become a ghost realm within ten days.”**

Temüjin’s eyes hardened like forged iron, somewhere between awe and alarm:
**“Is this sorcery?”**

Tömör said nothing — only smiled, eyes still fixed on the ever-turning Vision-Crows above.

**“It is an arrow in the wind. The living can fire it. But the dead... can still strike.”**

He bent down, dipped his finger in ash, and wrote three characters beside the fire:

**"Corpse Warfare."**

In the firelight, those ashen letters seemed to burn.





**【Memory · Arrow in the Wind · Tömör’s Second Revelation】**

On the battlefield, the howling of arrows, the thunder of hooves, and the clash of steel merged into a deafening roar. Temüjin’s gaze, sharp as a falcon’s, pierced through the smoke and chaos, scanning the front lines. The rhythm of battle quickened, and high above the fray, the Imperial Guard’s Tömör stood commanding his troops, turning now and then to speak to Temüjin about a remarkable new weapon.

Tömör’s eyes gleamed with resolve. His voice, low and firm, cut through the clamor as he issued commands and continued his explanation of the weapon’s ingenious design.

**“Great Khan, see how our heavy infantry struggles to break through their lines. Yet among the Imperial Guard, we wield a weapon that answers the challenge of armored foes with ease.”**

He raised a hand, pointing to a soldier locked in fierce combat. The warrior’s weapon flashed like a crescent moon, shifting forms with each movement. First, he blocked a lunging strike with the staff-like body, then spun, twisting the hilt — the blade sprang forth. In a fluid motion, he cleaved through the enemy’s shield with a sweeping horizontal slash.

**“Blade and hilt are forged as one — no crossguard, only a seamless transition. The grip flows naturally into the edge,”** Tömör continued, his gaze lingering on the junction of hilt and blade, as though he could already feel the weapon slicing through air.

**“This fluid design allows for rapid stance shifts in close combat. And as an anti-armor weapon, it tears through plate with ease.”**

Temüjin’s eyes were fixed on the fight, his interest clearly piqued. Tömör, sensing his curiosity, pressed on.

**“Its greatest strength lies in its *transformation*. When the blade is not needed, it reverts instantly to a staff — perfect for alley combat, where swift swings and blocks are crucial.”**

Tömör smiled faintly and lowered his voice:
**“Picture narrow city streets. Enemies closing in. Your guardsmen swing the staff with force, repelling foes without the delay of drawing a blade.”**

He paused, letting Temüjin form the image in his mind.
**“And when the enemy charges again, a simple twist of the grip releases the blade — ready to strike.”**

Temüjin closed his eyes, already envisioning the fluid violence, the choreography of transformation, the weapon flowing with the rhythm of battle.

**“And when heavily armored cavalry crashes into the lines,”** Tömör added, confidence surging in his voice,
**“your guards can instantly shift the weapon into a spear form. Thrusting. Piercing. Driving through armor.”**

He pointed toward a group of light cavalry executing a swift flank assault:
**“Look there — they wield the same weapon, transformed mid-ride into spears. One strike — and the enemy lines shatter. They gain the mobility of cavalry and the punch of a lance, all in one.”**

Temüjin nodded slightly, eyes keen as steel. In his mind, the weapon was already in use — in siege breaches, alley brawls, and cavalry charges. Each change in battlefield tempo, each shift in terrain or formation, was met with a seamless transformation of form and function.

**“Great Khan,”** Tömör said, bowing slightly, his voice resolute,
**“In the hands of your guardsmen, this is not just a weapon. It is a reflection of the warrior’s mind — flexible, adaptive, precise.”**

He paused, then added:
**“The smooth transition between hilt and blade, and the blood-channel groove along its core — these are not mere refinements. They keep blood from slicking the grip, ensuring control in the most desperate fights.”**

Temüjin listened in silence, a spark of contemplation in his eyes. He understood — this weapon was more than steel. It embodied tactical agility, the innovation of Mohist wisdom, and the art of turning design into doctrine. In the chaos of war, its transformation echoed the warrior’s insight and instinct.

**“Excellent,”** Temüjin finally spoke, voice calm but firm.
**“This is more than a weapon — it is the battlefield’s wild card, an extension of the warrior’s intellect. It shall become the emblem of my Imperial Guard. All must learn its ways — to adapt at any moment, and to win without fail.”**

Tömör bowed deeply, his voice unwavering:
**“Great Khan, the Imperial Guard stands ready to serve.”**





**\[Memoir: Arrow in the Wind – Tömör Revelation III]**

On a thunderous night filled with the beat of war drums, Temujin gathered all his generals inside the tent. The flickering light of torches cast shadows on their faces, and the air was thick with the scent of battle and the chill of cold steel. The commanders stood tall, eyes sharp as blades. Temujin stood before the map, silent for a moment, then finally spoke:

> "We will no longer fight solely for slaughter and conquest. From this moment forward, survival and suppression will be our primary goals. We will rewrite the rules of war. The strong are not merely those who strike hardest, but those who endure chaos—and break their enemies with fear and exhaustion."

The generals lowered their heads, listening as the Khan’s voice sank into their bones. Though his words were few, each carried undeniable weight. Temujin’s gaze swept the tent, piercing like a falcon’s eyes.

> "We will crush their morale. Let them die of disease, of unease, of despair. Remember—victory does not always require bloodshed. The true triumph is to make the enemy lose the will to fight. We will strike from the land, from the air, and from the darkness of night—leaving no space for retaliation."

At that moment, Tömör stepped forward, bowed deeply, and praised him:

> "The Khan’s strategy is brilliant. Letting the enemy die beneath our blades is just the surface. What truly breaks them is the fear planted deep within their hearts. We will make them feel anxiety and hopelessness in every inch of their land. That is our true victory."

Temujin nodded and continued:

> "Use their corpses as payloads for our trebuchets—hurl the dead into their cities. Let them learn that death is not the worst fate. The worst is having no place to hide, no grave to rest in."

The generals exchanged glances, stunned. Temujin walked slowly to Tömör, eyes profound:

> "With every strike, make them realize—this war is not led by us. It is led by a fate they cannot escape."

Tömör spoke in a low voice:

> "This is the tactic of ‘survival-based suppression.’ The enemy will be devoured by their own fear."

> "Exactly," Temujin replied with a calm smile. "Let them know—we do not fight for victory. We fight for survival. For a future where every war is no longer a gamble of life, but an exercise of control."

The air grew heavy with tension and expectation. Temujin looked around the tent one last time and whispered:

> "Go. Spread this idea to every soldier. Let them know—they fight not to defeat the enemy, but for themselves, and for our future. *‘Survival is output. Speed is suppression. Attrition is victory.’*"

Tömör understood, and with reverence and silent awe, he stepped out of the tent—ready to put into motion a strategy unlike any before it.

From that moment on, war entered a new era.






**\[Memoir: Arrow in the Wind – Tömör Revelation IV]**
*Night. On the steppe. Beside a campfire, wind howling in the dark.*

Tömör spoke in a low voice:

> “Khan, your cavalry rides like the wind, strikes like thunder. But I’ve come tonight not to speak of speed, but of *endurance*—and of *fear*.”

Temujin’s eyes were calm as he chewed dried meat.

> “Fear? The enemy’s—or my own men's?”

Tömör smiled faintly:

> “Both. Your warriors wear beast hides, bare their faces and arms—it is bravery. But when the front line stretches long, when cold night winds cut like blades, when the stench of blood chokes the soul… it is their spirit that shatters first.”

Temujin said nothing.

Tömör slowly unwrapped a bundle. In the firelight, silver gleamed—it was a set of finely crafted scale armor. The plates shimmered like fish scales, rustling silently with movement. Beneath was tightly woven silk, capable of stopping arrows and sealing wounds to prevent bleeding. The outer layer was thick beast hide, warm and camouflaging. The helmet was forged as one piece, a cold, imposing metal mask—leaving only the eyes visible, like a god descending to the battlefield.

Temujin gazed at the mask.

> “It looks like a demon.”

Tömör nodded:

> “Exactly. To the enemy, it *is* death incarnate. To our warriors, it is the soul of the war god they wear.”

He paused, pointing to the helmet and whispering:

> “The face is the root of a man. When you hide the face, your soldier fears death a little less. But to the enemy, it brings unease—for they cannot tell who you are, where you come from, or where you're going.”

Temujin was deep in thought.

Tömör continued:

> “In the Tang and Song dynasties, cavalry wore masks fused with their helmets for a reason—*face erasure*. It stripped the soldier of self, fusing him with the spirit of war. To the enemy, all they saw were countless *emotionless faces*, and their minds broke. The battle was lost before the first charge.”

He lifted a piece of the silk armor:

> “Do not underestimate this fabric. It cushions shock, stops bleeding—an arrow may pierce it, but it prevents death by blood loss. Tell me, how many good riders have we lost simply because they bled out?”

Temujin rose slowly, gazing into the dark horizon.

> “If out of every ten thousand horsemen, three thousand more could survive… I could conquer the entire steppe.”

Tömör replied:

> “Not just the steppe. The world.”

Amidst the sweeping winds and shifting sands, a great emperor truly understood:
**The outcome of war is not decided solely by weapons or speed, but by fear—and memory.**






**\[Memoir: Arrow in the Wind – Tömör Revelation V]**
*Background: The Golden Horde was newly founded. Northwestern tribes refused allegiance. Before winter set in, Temujin needed to crush rebellion and assert dominance over the steppe. He selected 2,000 elite warriors, for the first time equipped with Tömör’s gifted armor. Quietly, they marched under the name: “The Shadow-Faced Army.”*

---

**\[Before Dawn]**

The sky was still dark. Snow unmelted.
The hoofbeats of warhorses thudded like they were trampling through the enemy’s nightmares.
Two thousand armored riders moved like a silent tide, their black-scaled armor glinting like inked fish under the stars.
Each wore a full-face helmet, leaving only a narrow visor slit. Cold glimmers in their eyes, like the abyss itself watching.

They said nothing.
They waited in silence—like arrows sunk beneath the surface, ready to break the water at any moment.

---

**\[First Contact]**

The enemy was the Khasar tribe—5,000 strong, mixed light cavalry and infantry, camped by a river and confident in their numbers.
Scouts saw the dark army approach and shouted:

> “It’s Temujin!”

But what they saw next was not *men*.
It was a black wall rolling forward in utter silence.

There were no expressions. No faces. No shouts.
Only the sound of snow crushed beneath hooves—
And rows upon rows of faceless armored figures.

Fear rose like cold floodwater, welling up from deep inside.

---

**\[The Charge]**

With a single thunderous hoofbeat, Temujin drew his blade and cried:

> “*Altan Kharts!*” (Golden Souls!)

The armored cavalry erupted like a storm,
Two thousand riders cutting through frost like wind-blades, smashing directly into the enemy’s center.

The Khasar fired volleys of arrows—thick as locusts—but the scaled silk-layered armor slowed penetration.
Most riders sustained only light wounds and kept charging.
Worse yet—the enemy realized they were facing rank after rank of expressionless, soundless *black-faced figures*, like beings who would not die.

The men’s minds crumbled, though their lines held—for a moment.

---

**\[Psychological Collapse]**

The turning point came on the enemy’s left flank.
A young soldier fell in panic, looked back—and saw a rider bearing down on him, cold mask expressionless, blood dripping from his blade.
He screamed:

> “That’s not a man! That’s a demon!”

His cry lit a fire in dry grass—panic spread like flame.
The left camp wavered, then cracked.

At that moment, Temujin swept around the center, slicing into the rear with a flanking force.
Three-sided encirclement.
The enemy lines shattered. Soldiers fled in chaos.

In just half an hour, the 5,000-strong force was broken.
More than half were killed or wounded.
The rest surrendered.

---

**\[Aftermath]**

After the battle, Temujin stood amidst the field, looking at the soldiers wearing armor for the first time.
They did not cheer.
They did not leap in victory.
They stood—silent, still—like black stones among forest shadows.

He said:

> “You are no longer merely men. You are the shadow of my will. You are the war-soul of this land.”

Tömör, beside him, added quietly:

> “The enemy, upon seeing you, dares not meet your gaze.
> You, upon seeing the enemy, see only his retreat.”

This battle would later be remembered as:

**“The First Black-Faced Storm”**—
The true beginning of the *psychological evolution* of Mongol warfare.

From then on, **masks became battlefield symbols**.
**Scale armor became the shell of the soul.**
Temujin was no longer just the son of the wind—
He now wielded a weapon against fear itself.
And more than that—he had found a way to *elevate warriors beyond flesh and blood, into living totems.*





**【Memory: Arrow in the Wind – Tömör Revelation VI】**

Night had fallen. The fires of war were out, and the war drums lay silent.

Under the stars, Temujin stood alone atop the camp’s highest point, just returned from a battle that had shaken the steppe. His armor still encased him; frost had begun to bloom where wind met snow.

Tömör approached, his steps steady and soft. He said nothing, only knelt behind the Khan and began unfastening the clasps of his armor with practiced hands.

Piece by piece, the lamellar plates were removed—like layers of a heavy past being peeled away.

Temujin spoke in a low voice:
**“This armor is too heavy.”**

Tömör replied calmly:
**“It is the garment worn by civilization.”**

Temujin turned slightly, gazing at the mask he had just removed. His face unreadable, he asked:
**“Why must civilization be clad in the garb of war? Why must it always be iron and blood?”**

Tömör did not answer immediately. He removed the final strap from Temujin’s helmet, then said slowly:
**“Because peace is fragile. Until we build a system strong enough to contain desire, war must guard the hope of civilization.”**

He rose, eyes scanning the distant tents, and continued:
**“The Tang and Song dynasties tried. They had the ideals of the Mohists, they had science, ethics, a merit-based bureaucracy—even the art of winning without battle. But they failed. Do you know why?”**

Temujin remained silent.

Tömör looked at him, his gaze firm:
**“Because they could not abandon blood ties. They refused to let outsiders govern their state. They could not truly believe that reason could surpass blood. Even the Tanguts who adopted Han ways relied on marriage alliances to secure rule. Empire could only extend as far as bloodlines reached.”**

Temujin pondered:
**“Beyond blood—no one is to be trusted?”**

Tömör shook his head slowly:
**“Not so. Great Khan, you already made your choice.”**

His eyes turned toward the discarded mask:
**“When you rescued Börte and accepted Jochi as your heir, you began to break from the old steppe ways. You accepted the Mohist idea: that loyalty need not come from blood, but from culture and reason. That’s how you forged an empire.”**

Temujin looked to the stars, murmuring:
**“All empires have their end.”**

Tömör gave a soft laugh, tinged with a sorrowful serenity:
**“Yes, Great Khan. The Mongol Empire will fall. But the people under your rule—Persians, Turks, Tungus, Khitans—their souls will bear your mark forever. They have seen a grander order, witnessed the power of culture and reason. They will no longer settle for the old tribal glory. Across the world, they will rebuild, imitate, and reinvent… a new Mongol Empire.”**

Temujin turned to face Tömör. The firelight revealed a face both weary and resolute:
**“But will it still be mine?”**

Tömör bowed his head, answering softly:
**“It will belong to civilization. But your blood will run in their bones. They may call themselves by different names, raise banners in foreign tongues, but they will all carry the will to break through borders. They will live with freedom and resolve. And their roots will always point back to the steppe.”**

Temujin closed his eyes and took a deep breath of the cold grassland air:
**“Then let them go—like sparks, like falling stars. They don’t need to remain under my command. But they must light up the night sky.”**






**【Rational Return】**
**【Memory: The Handing Over and Transfer of Power Between Matrilineal and Wifely Lines】**

**Scene Setting:**
It’s late at night, and the camp’s light flickers faintly. Khe'eren summons Börte, and they sit together on the ground. Outside, the sound of a shamanic ritual drum echoes, the atmosphere in the camp heavy with gravity.

**Khe'eren** (softly, slowly):
**“Börte, over these years I’ve watched how you’ve treated Temujin, how you’ve managed the household with balance, never involving yourself in the affairs of state. You are clever, disciplined, a good wife. But now, it is time for you to speak.”**

**Börte** (cautiously):
**“Mother, speak your mind. But if this concerns Kököchü... he is, after all, the son of your husband. I…”**

**Khe'eren** (with a complex expression):
**“I know. He is the flesh and blood of Monglik, and I have called him my son. But you know how he has acted in these years. He has no respect for you, nor for Khasar, and even forced my youngest, Temüger, to kneel and apologize. He believes that the gods protect him, that the laws of the steppe were given by him. But I have seen it clearly—he has forgotten what ‘law’ truly means.”**

**Börte** (pausing in silence):
**“Why don’t you directly tell the Great Khan?”**

**Khe'eren** (with a steady gaze):
**“I cannot. I am now the wife of Monglik. If I speak, it becomes a matter of maternal kinship, of emotional interference in politics. But you, Börte, are different. You are the Khatun, his wife, the heartfire of the Khan. If you speak, it is for the law, it is for the clans and the people.”**

**Börte** (nodding gently):
**“You want me to remind him, not to let his reverence for the shaman overshadow his commitment to the law.”**

**Khe'eren** (gripping her hand):
**“Temujin is no longer just my son. He is the Khan of the entire steppe. If you truly love him, you must help him wake from his reverence for the divine and remember that he is the Khan, the lawgiver—not a worshiper. You and I both know, once the law of the steppe is ridden by sorcery, the steppe will no longer have the sun or the moon.”**





**Scene Description:**

The charcoal fire inside the yurt had already died out, leaving only faint residual warmth flickering in the ash. The night wind beat against the felt door, carrying the distant whistles of horse herders across the plains.

Night hung low. Outside, the wind swept up snow-dust, lashing at the felt door, its chill clinging like a shadow. But to Temujin, this was nothing more than the earth and sky offering their greeting to a son of the steppe.

He returned to his seat inside the tent, removing his heavy armor piece by piece, letting the rising steam from his body dissolve into the cold air. Dressed now in nothing but a thin pair of under-trousers, he rolled the pant legs high and plunged his bare feet into a wooden bucket of icy water. It had been drawn from the river—cold as iron—yet it awakened his blood like the first sprouts of spring grass.

The freezing water bit deep into his bones, yet made him feel vividly alive, as if the power of the entire land surged up through his soles. He reclined on a low couch, covering himself with a thick woolen blanket, letting the chill flow upward through his body. His mind grew all the clearer.

“Hot water lulls a man into dreams. Cold water reminds him he’s alive,” he murmured to himself, slowly closing his eyes.

Into this stillness, Börte slipped quietly through the curtain and sat beside him, disturbing nothing. She waited until he reached that liminal state between sleep and wakefulness before speaking, her voice soft and measured:
**“Khan, Mother Khe’eren says that from the day she married Monglik, many responsibilities were no longer hers, but mine.”**

Temujin’s breathing was calm, like a silent night after snowfall. He was not truly asleep; those ears, sharpened by years of hunting and war, still caught every thread of sound. Börte knew this and continued gently:

**“Mother Khe’eren—she said little. But her silence is not surrender. It is her turning away. She is a mother, yes, and the elder matron of the clan. But now, she is also a wife. From the moment she took that role, the duty passed to me.”**

She reached to adjust his blanket, her tone tender but her eyes increasingly resolute:

**“Khan, I know you revere the shamans. You once said they commune with spirits—that they are the bridge between heaven, earth, and our people. But if a bridge begins to rot, travelers must find another path. Not wait for it to collapse and bury them with it.”**

Temujin did not respond, only shifted his feet, sending a ripple through the cold water. He offered no rebuttal—that was permission for her to go on.

**“Kököchü stirred conflict between Khasar and Temüge. You think it’s a quarrel among brothers. But I saw clearly—it is the power of the shaman, twisting your sense of mercy into a tool for private schemes.”**

Börte paused, her voice lowering:

**“You are the Heaven-chosen son of the steppe. You must no longer let the will of ‘spirits’ cloud your judgment. The light of the court must eventually outshine the illusions cast by firelight in the tent.”**

She reached out, touching the rim of the wooden bucket. The water had grown slightly warmer, but still held its piercing cold.

**“Cold water awakens the body—and it should awaken the part of you that sees the steppe not through divine signs, not through fate, but through your own eyes.”**

She rose and left quietly, her words falling like drops of water onto stone—sinking deep into its core.

Outside, the wind howled, but no longer felt cruel. Temujin remained still with eyes closed, but within his mind, a silent storm had already begun to rise.






**Stage Play · Recollection: The Death of Kokochu**

**Scene: A dimly lit tribunal in the center of a great tent. A fire brazier casts flickering shadows. People stand in a circle. The High Arbiter presides at the center. Temujin walks in slowly. Kokochu kneels at the center, cloaked in a tattered ceremonial robe, his expression complex.**

**Temujin (in a deep voice, walking slowly forward)**
Kokochu.
You rendered great service in spreading the Law of the Steppe.
It was you who planted the roots of order in these boundless plains.
You once brought discipline to the tribes, and loyalty to the people.
(pauses, staring intently)
But you seem to have misunderstood something.
Did you think this order existed because of *you*—your power, your greatness?
Did you think the Law’s legitimacy came from you, rather than from the ancestors and people who died to uphold it?

**Kokochu (a mix of confusion and resentment)**
I gave my life to the prosperity of the Law of the Steppe—do I not deserve a voice in matters of state?
(rising)
It was I who made the Law succeed. I gave it life!
Must all my devotion now be denied?

**Temujin (calmly, eyes like steel)**
You overstepped your bounds.
You sought to overthrow your ruler.
You forgot your place.
(slowly approaching)
You failed to grasp the line between *power* and *law*.
You have no right to place yourself above the law—not even as the most powerful shaman of the Steppe.
The law was not made for one man. It is watched over by all.
Even you are no exception.

**Kokochu (softly, voice trembling)**
Then what am I… in the eyes of this Law?

**Temujin (coldly)**
You are one among many who carried it forward.
You are not its creator.
You are not its father.
The power of the Law belongs to no one.
It comes from the wind, the blood, the sacrifice of thousands.

(pauses, then turns to face the crowd)
The Law is a mountain.
It crushes fools—and heroes alike.
The future of the Steppe lies not in the dream of any mystic,
but in our shared reason and unity.

(turns again to Kokochu)
I know your merits, and I do not deny them.
But…
The State protects you—
It does not define you.
Who you are—that is between you and the heavens.
It is not the concern of the State.

**(He steps forward, voice resolute)**
The Law of the Steppe is not a tool for deification.
It was not made to crown saints, mediums, or prophets.
It was made so that *all* of us—including I, Temujin, and you, Kokochu—
may live with reason, and in equality.

(tone like a drumbeat)
We live **under** the Law, not above it.

**High Arbiter (solemn and grave, to the crowd)**
Kokochu.
The Law of the Steppe has stood for years.
All must abide by it.
You once upheld it—
Now you seek to destroy it.
You disrupt the realm.
You claim divine voice and declare yourself above all.
That crime is unforgivable.
(heavily)
By the Law of the Steppe—
**Treason merits death!**

**(The stage falls silent as a tomb)**

**Temujin (nodding slowly, his voice cold as a blade)**
You die not out of personal grudge—
But because you betrayed the only truth we all believe in:
**The Law.**

**(Temuge and three executioners step forward. The sound of chains thunderously echoes. Kokochu does not resist. He simply closes his eyes and sighs deeply.)**

**Stage SFX: Chains strike down. A sharp bone-cracking sound. Kokochu collapses. Blood splashes. Lights abruptly change.**

**(Temujin turns to face the audience)**
This is for the future of the Steppe.
For your future.
The rule of law—**is unshakable**.
Those who defy it face only one path:
**Death.**

**(He signals. An old shaman of the Ba’alin tribe, Uusun the Elder, is brought forth.)**

**Temujin**
Elder Uusun.
You kept to your bounds. You did not covet power.
I name you the new High Shaman.
Lead the people of the Steppe.
Guard our faith, and uphold the law.

**Uusun the Elder (bowing deeply)**
Great Khan.
The Shamanic faith is not for the use of any one man.
It exists forever for the Steppe, and the Mandate of Heaven.

**(Curtain falls. The wind howls in the dark.)**







**\[Settling the Score with Fate]**
*Final Chapter Scene: The Siege of Shenyang*

**\[Scene opens]**
Vast snowfields. Still wind.
The camera looks down on the city of Shenyang (formerly Zhongjing of Jin). Thick smoke hangs over the city walls. Mongol formations stretch like a forest, banners snapping in the wind.

**\[Character Entrance]**
Temujin stands atop a high ridge, clad in heavy armor but bare-headed, his expression calm.
He is flanked only by two riders—Belgutei and Luan.

**\[Luan speaks · quietly, deeply]**
"The Khan bears no hatred for the Jurchens.
He merely sees a dynasty whose end has already been declared by its own people.
Rumors run rampant within the city, children's rhymes fill the streets.
No one believes in the emperor’s will anymore, nor is anyone willing to die for it.
Jin needs no conquest—only a final push."

**\[Camera shifts]**
Temujin gazes into the city, his face carved in stone.
After a long pause, he speaks slowly, voice as steady as the snow:

**Temujin:**
"In days past, the House of Zhao survived in humiliation.
Today, I shall balance those old accounts in their stead.
This land shall suffer no newborn empire."

**\[Long shot]**
Belgutei hears this, bows his head silently.
Hand tight on the reins, he stands like a statue.
Temujin doesn’t look at him—only exhales two cold words:

**Temujin:**
"Wipe them out."

**\[Scene shift]**
The Mongol cavalry surges forward like a tidal wave toward Shenyang.
War drums thunder. Fire arrows split the sky.
On the city walls, startled royal children and elders awake to chaos—
Screams of fear blending with the blare of horns.






**\[Luan · Final Monologue]**

> "The Great Khan settled the score with blood, cleansed the land with fire—
> Yet spared the Zhao Song to the south.
> Because, like him, they too were rational remnants of the Tang.
> The Khan knew: empires will fall,
> But reason does not die."

> "Central Asia was too good.
> The Khitans forgot the way home.
> They forgot the homeland that demanded bowed heads and walls day and night.
> Western Liao wasn’t a collapse—it was a rebirth.
> It was an exodus from patriarchal oppression.
> They didn’t return—not because they forgot their ancestors,
> But because, for the first time, they became themselves."

*After Luan finishes, Temujin stands in the wind, his gaze fixed on the golden horizon of the western sky. He murmurs slowly:*

> "The Khitans... they never came back.
> Was it because the West was too kind to them?"

> "But if that’s true,
> Why then did neither Western Xia nor Jin ever truly try to *control* the steppe?"

> "They always skirted around it—
> As if afraid to be tainted.
> Or maybe... as if they *meant* to leave this chaos behind."

> "Did the Khitans flee?
> Or were they driven out?
> Did they really abandon the legitimacy that Central Plains civilization had once bestowed?"

> "Western Xia held the Western Regions.
> Jin held the Central Plain.
> But neither dared claim the steppe—they only meddled at its edges.
> Jin even fostered infighting here for years, as though..."

> "...as though they *wanted* the steppe to remain in chaos forever."

> "Was this an unspoken pact among the three kingdoms?
> Or... was there something greater behind them all?
> Who fears a unified steppe?"

*(Temujin turns to Luan, voice low and weighty.)*

> "You say Western Liao was reborn—
> Yet what they left behind was a grey zone no one dared approach.
> The steppe belongs to no empire,
> Yet every empire has secretly plotted over it."

**Luan speaks slowly:**

> "The steppe isn't the only grey zone.
> South of Western Xia, the Wei River Plain—
> Supposedly under Jin control—
> In truth, no one dares govern it outright.
> Warlords rise and fall, bandits roam.
> Whenever one power intervenes,
> Another strikes from the shadows.
> The Song did it.
> So did Western Xia.
> Even the Jin were devoured by their own hand."

> "It’s a *buffer soaked in blood*—
> Chaos by design, to stabilize borders.
> The price? Generations of suffering among commoners and soldiers alike."

> "Absurd, isn’t it? But since the An Lushan Rebellion,
> This land has never known peace.
> When the Tang fell, warlordism rooted itself in the system.
> The Zhao clan—
> A dynasty of scholars—
> Had to rely on Khitan cavalry to ascend the throne.
> The rightful Zhou bloodline became bargaining chips—
> As if someone pressed pause on the chaos."

> "But it was only a pause, not an end.
> The peace you see is a peace of *agreements*,
> Not a peace of *systems*."

*(Luan’s eyes lock onto Temujin.)*

> "The bloodline states never escaped the Tang framework.
> The Song only knows how to maintain order.
> The Jin seek profit.
> Western Xia seeks survival.
> They all pretend to fight—
> But in truth, they’re conspiring to uphold a structure none dare break."

> "We are still living under the shadow of the An Lushan Rebellion—
> Only no one dares admit it."

*(His voice softens, but grows stronger.)*

> "The Mohists chose you because you are *outside* this system.
> You don’t inherit the Tang.
> You owe nothing to the Zhaos.
> You are not chained to military bureaucracy.
> And you don’t fear the spread of MIC."

> "You are strong—
> Not because of your own power,
> But because your *structure* attracts those who make you stronger."

> "You were never meant to fight *in* this war.
> You were meant to *end* it."





**Luan** *(stern, eyes blazing)*:
“Great Khan, your destined success lies not in divine mandate, but in the fact that you have broken through the upper limits of the Tang system.”
“Since the An Lushan Rebellion in 755, the deaths of millions have forged a single iron law: no new order can be born without destroying the old.”
“Through centuries of civil war, feudal divisions, courtly bargains, and dynastic change, all the limits of the old regime have, at last, been shattered by your hand.”
“The Mongol Empire is not a barbarian accident of history. It is the inevitable outcome of the Tang system’s end—and the beginning of a new civilization.”
“If the Mongols decline in the future, it will not be due to powerful enemies, but because your descendants betray the system you built.”
“Anyone who wishes to rule the world must replicate the skeleton of your system and refine its inner spirit—otherwise, they will only ever struggle at the limits you’ve already surpassed.”
“Your name, Great Khan, no longer belongs to the history books. It has been embedded into the system itself.”
“Your greatness will not be judged by how your descendants sing your praises—but by who dares to rewrite the rules you designed.”

**Temujin** *(silent for a long time, gazing toward the western dusk)*:
“I did not conquer these lands so my heirs could feast in comfort—I did it so the system would ensure that no one, ever, overreaches.”
“Bloodlines are the crutch of the weak. Kinship is the poison of tribes. After I die, if anyone boasts of being ‘Genghis Khan’s descendant,’ I’ll be the first to destroy him—before the enemy even draws near.”

*(He rises, his tone hard as iron)*

“Send the order: establish the **Steppe Assembly**—the Seven Tribes shall debate national policy together, no decision may be made by the Khan’s clan alone.”
“Create the **Right Court of Inspection**, dedicated to investigating corruption among the nobility—no relatives allowed, no horses permitted in camp, no sharing drinks with soldiers.”
“This is not for mercy. It is to ensure my empire never reverts to the Tang system.”

“Institutions are the emperor’s corpse. Before I die, I will forge mine into a copper coffin—and bury it in every general’s mind.”

**\[Final Shot]**
Temujin’s back silhouetted, Shenyang in flames, snow falling again.
The screen fades to black.
**End credits begin to roll.**





**The Ritual of the System: The Central Plains Cannot Return to Cultural Sovereignty**

Once, in the heart of the Central Land (the core region of the Zhongyuan culture), Heaven's mandate was self-assumed, and the rituals and teachings were beyond question.
Any dissenting voices were labeled as barbarians or traitors.
In this vast world, only one bell was allowed to sound;
Among the multitude, no alternative thought was permitted to take root.

After the An Lushan Rebellion, the realm was torn by endless wars, and power was monopolized by usurpers.
For a hundred years, no new system was created, and for a thousand years, no freedom of thought was seen.
The Zhao family usurped the throne, bringing the Khitan under their control, and blocked reforms of the Later Zhou,
Thus ensuring that the cultural sovereignty of the Central Plains would never be broken again.

The steppe still carries whispers, lone eagles, and raging fires,
The South still holds scrolls, rice waves, and dreams,
But only the Central Plains remain, stifled in pressure, like fish trapped in a well.
Those born here face only two fates:
Either to survive in the suffocating rituals, or to rise violently to the pinnacle of power struggles.

You and I know, once cultural power is confined to the central plains,
The steppe, Lingnan, the Southwest, and the Gansu-Luoyang region will all fall under cultural colonization,
The diversity of systems, the prosperity of languages, and the autonomy of ethnic groups,
All will be silenced beneath the words “Dynastic Legitimacy.”

Thus, you and I block the cultural sovereignty of the Central Plains, not to destroy the nation,
But for the coexistence of all nations; not to suppress,
But to allow for the spontaneous evolution of systems.

You and I build a system, not based on bloodline, nor upon divine authority,
Only the system can optimize itself, only consensus can replicate itself,
Only when culture has no central heart, can it continue to beat for ages.

You and I are neither emperors, nor sages, nor teachers.
You and I are the awakeners of systems,
The silent tailors of future civilizations.




**The Milk of the Gray Wolf · The Gravitational Field of the System**

**Temujin said:**

“People say that I swept the land with iron cavalry and established a nation with the edge of the sword, but this is not so. The foundation of an empire is not the warhorse, but the system. The milk of the wolf nourishes my people; my laws nourish the world.”

“I fear not mountains nor rivers, nor do I fear strong enemies, but I fear the scattering of hearts and tribes acting independently. Therefore, I established the ‘Council of Governance,’ not based on bloodlines or status, but on who can bring benefit to the people. By uniting the wisdom of many into one wisdom, and the interests of many into one interest. This is the ‘Steppe Governance,’ not for today, but for all ages.”

“I do not seek the world to submit to me, but to make the world willing to be used by me. Skilled craftsmen, rare soldiers, wise men, merchants, and sorcerers come from afar, not because I am strong, but because I am just. A system is like a wellspring; the deeper the well, the more people will draw from it. Justice is like the well, and people will naturally return to it.”

“The world believes the empire is strong because of iron and blood; they do not know that what truly makes my Mongol Empire stand proud among all nations is that everyone can speak, everything can be debated, the worthy gain positions, and the rebellious are punished. I take the world as my home, and the system as my creed.”

“If my descendants forget this origin, forsake the law for profit, abandon consultation for autocracy, though they may have thousands of cavalry, they will eventually fall into ruin. An empire’s downfall comes not from enemy soldiers, but from a divided heart among its people.”

“My name does not await my descendants to write it; it is already embedded within this system. Whoever upholds my law, they are my children; whoever betrays my system, even if they are of my blood, they are my enemies.”





**End Credits Easter Egg: The Final Instructions of Temujin**

In the great tent, the flickering candlelight cast long shadows, and the air was filled with the familiar scent of the Mongolian steppe — dry, silent, and imbued with a profound, unspoken strength. Temujin, though aged and frail, still had a sharp gleam in his eyes, like that of a hawk.

He lay quietly on a leather-covered bed, surrounded by his loyal generals and closest family members. The wind of the Mongolian steppe continued to blow through the tent, and he could clearly hear the distant ringing of horse bells, as though the echoes of his lifetime of battles and journeys were reverberating in his ears.

His wife, Borte, stood at his bedside, her eyes glistening with tears, her heart heavy with emotions. She dared not speak, afraid of disturbing her husband’s final moments.

Temujin raised his head slightly, paused for a moment, and then spoke. His voice was low but powerful, as if he were issuing one last command:

“Borte, I know my life has come to an end. My fate has long been intertwined with this land, but the boundaries of the empire, and the inheritance of our culture, will remain immortal. The Mongol Empire that you and I built was not merely for the continuation of our bloodline, but for the sovereignty of our culture. Remember, no matter the tribe or the person, whoever picks up the nomadic cultural sovereignty will become a new Mongol, and their empire will rise again, becoming the new Mongol Empire.”

He paused for a moment, gazing at his family and generals, as if imparting a prophetic vision to them.

“Whether our descendants continue to rule or not, the spirit of Mongolia will always exist. You will become the ancestors of the future Mongols, witnesses to their free lives, as we once lived. I have heard the news from Xingqingfu. After my death, only by conquering it can this history truly end, and my departure be truly declared. Every inch of land in Xingqingfu must become free of bloodshed and tears, destroying all roots that do not belong to us.”

He closed his eyes briefly, inhaling deeply as though gathering his strength for one last command: “We must attack the Song Kingdom. They have already gained an advantage through maritime trade. We, on the other hand, rely on land trade, but at the edges of this vast steppe, our competitive edge is weakening. Our path is destined to collide with the Song Kingdom’s hegemony.”

“I once thought that after conquering the world, we could trade freely with all. I sent merchant caravans with furs, horses, slaves, and ores, to meet the coastal nations. They looked, then laughed.

They said: ‘Your goods are too few, too monotonous.’

I did not believe them. I brought the best warhorses from the steppe, treasures taken from Khwarazm, and wealth earned through bloodshed. Yet they still laughed, as though watching a bunch of country bumpkins.

It wasn’t until I crossed the Persian Plateau and saw the port that I understood. I saw the ships of the Song.

Those ships were as vast as cities, carrying silverware, porcelain, silk, tea, spices, toys... an endless variety, spilling from the holds like a divine gift. What surprised me even more was that they didn’t use gold or silver. They held paper in their hands, strange patterned paper, which they called ‘money.’

I asked the Persians at the port, ‘Do you trust them?’

They replied, ‘We don’t trust them. We trust the Song Kingdom behind that paper.’

In that moment, I realized, we are too poor. Not because we haven’t looted enough, but because we don’t even know what wealth truly is.

War can only take bones, but the Song uses trade to control souls. I conquered half the world, yet I couldn’t even afford one of their ports.”

He paused, as if reflecting on what to say next, his gaze becoming more resolute. “Tell the children, never dishonor the Song royal family. Although their emperor is our enemy, there will certainly be some who will return to Helan Mountain and restore the bloodline of the steppe. This place is not just our origin; its future is destined to welcome those who belong to us.”

He paused again, as though he were implanting the future into their minds: “That person may no longer ride horses or shoot arrows, nor will they glorify bloody war songs. They may wear official hats, dress in southern clothing, and even speak and read in Chinese. But in their heart, there will be wind, the steppe, and the blood of tribal coexistence. They will understand — the true empire is a fusion of the Mongol military system's organizational strength and the wealth of the Song’s trade system. They will not rely on conquest to win, but on integration, controlling trade routes and taxes, and bringing everything under a new order. At that time, Mongolia will no longer be a single ethnicity, but the framework of civilization.”

Temujin took a deep breath and continued with his final instructions: “As I once said, we will mix our bloodlines, destroying those who cling to the ‘blood tribe,’ not to monopolize bloodlines, but to eliminate the slaves who hold onto the concept of lineage. We will expand the borders of our people to encompass all future steppe lands. Perhaps one day, someone will rebuild the Mongol Empire in a new era, but I will not live to see that moment. You may not be my blood descendants, but I will always live in your spirit.”

He smiled faintly, seemingly weary, yet unwilling to relinquish his unfinished mission: “My descendants, in the future, you need not preserve my name, nor guard this land. As long as cultural sovereignty exists, the Mongol Empire will never perish.”

Temujin fell silent, as though he had finished everything he needed to say. The generals lowered their heads, bowing respectfully, aware that their leader was approaching the end of his life. Borte also lowered her head, allowing tears to streak down her face.

Temujin closed his eyes, as if he had laid down his final burden. However, he did not pass away immediately. For half a month, he remained in a semi-conscious state, as if fighting a final battle with fate.

It was only days after the fall of Xingqingfu that the news of Temujin’s death was publicly announced. He died by the iron blood and decisiveness that defined his life, but his thoughts and spirit, like the wind, blew across the steppe, into the future empire and the culture that would follow.




**"They once drank from the same cup of fierce mare's milk, but now they raise their swords to challenge the heavens."**

You and I were born in a prairie still scorched by war, where the eagles no longer soar, leaving only smoke and wails behind.
We remember our grandfather's words: "The Great Khan’s system is the roof of the world; when it collapses, everyone will be buried beneath the rubble."

Yet, in the court of the Yuan dynasty, people began speaking Chinese, wearing silk robes, burning incense, and worshipping Buddha. The iron cavalry was shackled by regulations, and the herders were imprisoned within household registrations. Kublai Khan sat on the imperial throne of the Central Plains, yet he made us lose the courage to rule the world.

When the "Prairie Council" lit the beacon fires again at the old site of Chagatai, it was not just a rebellion—it was an account to be settled. We must ask: Who betrayed the system? Who sold out the Great Khan's oath?

Mongolia should not have an emperor; it should only have a system.

So, the Ilkhanate marched west, the Kipchaks raised their flag to the east, and the legacy of Ögedei gathered forces to march north. These brothers, divided for centuries, finally united to form a war machine called the "Anti-Yuan Mongol Empire Alliance"—
They were not fighting to rebuild, but to pass judgment.

Then we saw hell.
The entire Eurasian continent twisted and groaned in the flames, mothers and sons were buried together, tribes and cities became powder kegs.
You may have seen the slain in battle, but you have not heard the cries of the millions of souls who ended their lives due to the collapse of systems, the disintegration of order, and the confusion of faith.

And you and I stand on this line of fracture.

We can choose to join the precise legions of the Yuan, preserving the current order;
We can also throw ourselves into the fire of prairie revival, fighting for the freedom that no longer pays tribute.

But no matter what we choose, we know—
This is not just a war; it is a judgment on the civilization’s system.

Blood will be shed, but the rules will remain.

This is the War of Fracture.






### **Afterword | Milk of the Black Box**

Civilization is never born in the sunlight.
It grows slowly in the dark, inside a black box.

Not because of enlightenment.
Not because of freedom.
Not because human nature is kind.

What truly drives the leap of civilization
is ambiguous language, unfinished oaths,
and rules that must not be named.
At the heart of every system lies a mechanism
that cannot be exposed.
If you try to shine a light on it,
it disintegrates into dust.

Temüjin’s empire expanded
because command could outrun consensus.
The Song dynasty’s commerce flourished
because scholars never understood
how the ledgers were written.
And the modern world remains in balance
because the black box still hums beneath everything.

It has simply learned to stay silent.
To disguise itself as “the way things are.”

I have not revealed it in full.
I merely left a faint trace
where the milk of the grey wolf falls.

If you understand it,
you are already part of the conspiracy.
