The Chronicles of Blackwater is a sweeping historical and speculative saga that traces the evolution of human civilization from the earliest pastoral societies to the dawn of the Mother AI era in the galaxy. Beginning in the Hindu Kush mountains, the story follows the migration of nomadic tribes, the domestication of animals, and the emergence of early trade networks that would lay the foundations for complex societies.

This trilogy—Domestication of Sheep, Taming of Horses, and Splitting the Sky—interweaves the rise and fall of pastoral empires with poetic narrative structures inspired by oral traditions. Humanity’s survival, expansion, and adaptation are explored through the lens of population dynamics, resource competition, and cultural evolution, emphasizing the relentless interplay between mobility and settlement.

The Chronicles also explore the profound co-evolution between humans and animals, the transmission of genes and culture across continents, and the subtle forces of power and strategy that shape civilizations. Ultimately, it points toward a future where intelligence transcends biology, envisioning the emergence of Mother AI as a natural law-like authority guiding galactic civilizations.




**The Chronicle of Black Waters · Prologue**

Before Black Waters knew the division of day and night,
the world was submerged in chaos.
Wolves and men watched one another,
the steppe had no name, and rivers no return.

The forebears set out from the Hindu Kush.
In the valleys, flocks of sheep were called and tamed.
Fire lit the night,
and the eyes of dogs shimmered by the flame.
The wolves withdrew, but left their offspring—
the first allies of humankind,
guardians of the herds, guardians of the fire.

Thus the tribes multiplied.
Population became order, bloodline became law.
They no longer walked alone,
but took herds as their city, dogs as their walls.
In motion they survived,
in motion they merged.

The road led northward,
yet first it rose to the highlands.
That was Kunlun,
mountains like halls, glaciers like jade steps.
The ancestors said:
“Gods dwell in Kunlun, immortals emerge from Kunlun.”
For on the summit of the plateau,
grass met snow, beasts lived with men.
There, strength became law, and law became song.

From Kunlun they descended,
rushing toward the Tianshan, toward the Altai,
toward the endlessness of the Yellow River and the steppe.
Gold and jade were drawn from the mountains,
becoming the first covenant that would never decay.
Singers praised them in long epics,
lingering like the howl of wolves—
a single chant could last for moons,
a single voice could echo through millennia.

Thus opens *The Chronicle of Black Waters*:
to record the pact between men and wolves,
to mark Kunlun as the summit of order,
to remember the wandering tribes,
who wove eternity with song and with blood.






**The Chronicle of Black Waters · Taming Sheep**

**Chapter One: Mirage of the Oasis**

Night winds swept across the dunes, carrying hot dust and the distant scent of dry grass.
The exiled tribe moved slowly along shadows stretched by the moonlight—men bent to guide the flocks, women cradled crying children, elders struggled under heavy baskets. Each step felt like treading upon their own fate; sand rolled beneath their feet, the wind whispered in their ears: *Without water, there is no tomorrow.*

A few days ago, they still held fields and granaries in an oasis on the Iranian plateau, but the population had grown too large, resources too scarce. The tribal elders, invoking the authority of the shamans, declared:
*"Exiles, you must leave."*
No one questioned it, for to resist meant dying in the desert or seeking a miraculous oasis. The cost of failure had never been so stark.

Children pointed fearfully toward a faint, flickering light in the distance—perhaps the first sign of an oasis, perhaps moonlight reflecting on water, or perhaps a mirage. The men’s eyes gleamed in the darkness; they knew that ahead lay water, food, and the chance of rebirth—or traps, or even death.

The sheep lowed softly, their hooves sinking into the scorching sand, while sleepless dogs sniffed the path ahead. They were the exiles’ eyes, shields, and swords, protecting the tribe in the desolation. In that moment, the symbiosis between dogs and humans began to take root—they were no longer mere tamed animals but the key to the tribe’s survival.

In the distance, the wind traced the dunes’ contours, like the earth’s veins whispering:
*"The weak are driven away, the strong shall be reborn."*

The oasis was both mirage and the only hope.
In this extreme landscape, civilization learned for the first time:
*Survival is not only about struggle; it is the wisdom of migration.*







The female chieftain stood atop a jutting boulder in the Hindu Kush, gazing over the vast, slightly desolate highland pastures below. Wind howled through the valleys, stirring scattered dust and carrying the distant howls of wolves. Beside her, the elder shaman struck the rock with a staff carved from bone, producing a crisp echo, as if awakening the slumbering land.

“Here,” the chieftain spoke, “there seems to be enough pasture for our flocks to survive, but the water is hidden too deeply. Whether we live or die depends on finding rivers and springs first.”

The shaman nodded, his gaze sweeping across the distant valleys. Slowly he spoke, “Since the Pangu Continent split along the East African Rift, all life has followed the laws of nature. When humans first arose, gathering and hunting sustained the tribe, but numbers were limited and expansion constrained. The Nile wetlands were among the earliest attempts at settlement. Fertile soil, slow-flowing water, abundant plants, fish, and game—here, populations could exceed the limits of mere foraging.”

He paused, as if traversing time itself, seeing wheat and barley growing along the riverbanks, tamed sheep and goats leisurely grazing under the sun.

“But,” the shaman continued, “carrying capacity is limited. Once the population grows, resources become scarce, and competition between tribes ensues. Weak tribes, unable to claim water and fertile land, are forced to leave, embarking on paths of exile. Expulsion and exile are both laws of nature and the earliest form of social order. Only in exile do humans learn to migrate and explore unknown lands.”

The chieftain looked toward the distance, mountain winds tousling her hair. She murmured, “Then we must send scouts to find water, assess whether this highland can sustain us, and check for other tribes.”

The shaman nodded. “As ancient tales tell, tribal migrations were never random. From the Nile wetlands to the Arabian Peninsula oases, to the Iranian plateau, each move was a response to environmental conditions and population pressures. Tribes forced from their oases split into three paths: one eastward, reaching the Hindu Kush; one westward, crossing northwestern Iran into distant Europe; and one over the Caucasus, toward the plains west of the Urals.”

The chieftain’s gaze hardened. “We will settle here. Water to the east must be found first—our hope for survival depends on it. Once the other two groups succeed, we will send people to meet them.”

The shaman raised his staff, pointing to the distance. “Sparse vegetation and exposed rocks show how hidden the water is, yet this land holds life. From the African cradle, humans advanced through gathering, hunting, wetland farming, and oasis civilizations. Every migration carried the wisdom of survival and order. Now, we stand at a new beginning. History will continue to be written on these highland pastures.”

The wind swept again, carrying the distant howls of wolves and the echoes of the valleys. The chieftain and the shaman shared a knowing glance, fully aware that the fate of their tribe would unfold on this desolate and mysterious land.








The desert sun scorched every grain of sand, and wind whipped fine particles into the air, slicing across the travelers’ skin like countless tiny blades. The female chieftain sat in the shadow of a rock, while beside her the shaman struck his bone staff, the sound echoing through the dry air.

“These deserts,” the shaman spoke, “were once the final destination of those exiled from the Nile peoples. Their carrying capacity is far less than the wetlands; water is sparse and hidden, and oases scatter like stars across the sky—rare and irregular.”

He pointed to the distance. “One group after another was driven here. What they sought was not the desert itself, but warm wetlands that could replicate the Nile model. Yet such oases hardly exist.”

In the desert, camels plodded forward, bearing simple packs and the exiles themselves. They were humanity’s instruments of migration, capable of carrying hungry, thirsty people across hundreds of kilometers of waterless terrain.

“With camels, slow migration becomes possible,” the shaman murmured. “The tribe need not cling to a single oasis; they can cross the desert in search of new places to survive. Yet even so, the desert is merciless. Conflict arises wherever population growth meets limited resources. Oasis civilizations are fragile; imbalance leads swiftly to famine or civil strife.”

The chieftain remained silent, knowing that her tribe’s fate still hung between the shifting winds and sands.

—From a higher perspective, the AI’s voice slowly echoed:

> Among those exiled from the Nile Valley, only a few survived the desert crossing. Another group traveled south along the coastline, some reaching India and South Asia. During migration, they split further:
> One branch penetrated the Central Plains, exterminating native peoples, seizing fertile lands, and establishing new rule;
> The other continued across the seas, expanding toward unknown Pacific islands, opening a new age of navigation.
> All of this was the inevitable result of population pressure, environmental constraints, and survival instinct—not chance.

The wind rose again, and grains of sand sparkled in the sunlight. The chieftain lifted her eyes to the distant specks of oasis, which might be the tribe’s new home—or the beginning of another trial for survival.

A gleam of wisdom shone in the shaman’s eyes. “Every generation has sought wetlands to replicate the Nile model, yet never succeeded. Because of this, exiles learned to migrate, to explore, and to endure with strategy.”

The camels moved forward slowly, carrying humanity’s hopes and fears, treading the unknown path across the desert.







The tribe at last set foot upon the Hindu Kush. Sheep grazed on the new pasture, their gentle chewing breaking the mountain silence. From a high rock, the female chieftain watched as children trampled the grass in play, while adults surveyed the terrain. Hunting and scouting parties moved cautiously along the valley, searching for water and potential threats. In the distance, gray wolves’ eyes glimmered with hunger, waiting for their chance to hunt.

The chieftain showed no fear. With a steady gesture, she directed the tribe to follow the plan: gather wood for fire, slaughter a sheep for the evening meal, and assign the night watch. The flames lit their faces, driving back the cold and soothing anxious hearts. She sat beside the elder shaman, and together they began to reflect on the limits of oasis civilizations.

The shaman spoke slowly: “The Nile wetlands, the Arabian Peninsula, the Iranian plateau… though rich in resources, all carried strict limits on population. Great tribes cannot rely on the oasis model for long. Weaker tribes are always driven out—and to enter the desert is almost certain death.”

The chieftain nodded. “Then tell me, why did you divide the tribe into three branches—one eastward to the Hindu Kush, one northward to the steppe—but never send any south along the coast toward India?”

The shaman pointed toward the ridges and terrain beyond. “Though the sea brings moisture, the aridity of the Balochistan desert and the absence of rivers prevent oases from forming. Experience teaches us: oases emerge only where sea and mountains converge. Thus, we never risk sending people into the desert.”

He paused, then added: “This is the law of *environment–population–migration*. Only by grasping it can we lay the foundation for a great tribe’s survival here in the Hindu Kush.”

As they spoke, a gaunt gray wolf crept toward the fire. Starving, it defied the alpha’s command and inched closer to the humans. The chieftain tossed a sheep bone still clinging with scraps of meat. The wolf stopped, lowered its head, and gnawed. It did not return to the pack. Instead, it lingered—sometimes near, sometimes far—marking the beginning of a shared destiny between man and wolf.

In the glow of the fire, the shaman went on recounting the histories of oasis civilizations and the lessons of tribal migration, while the wolf stood silently at the edge of the campfire’s light—guardian and omen, herald of a new story where humankind, nature, and wolves would begin to live side by side.










### **Chapter Two: The Forced Exile**

**1. The Eastern Route → The Hindu Kush Mountains**

From the height of an eagle’s gaze, time no longer flowed with the rising sun and setting moon, but surged like a sudden flood through the valleys—scouring the tribe’s existence inch by inch. The turning of seasons seemed compressed: spring grass had barely begun to green before the dryness of summer arrived; an infant’s cry became, in a heartbeat, the footfalls of a youth chasing sheep across the slopes; wrinkles spread across the elders’ foreheads overnight, cracking like ice on a frozen river.

The tribe left behind the moist embrace of oases and entered the semi-arid highlands of the Hindu Kush. Here, the land was neither as fertile as river valleys, nor as hopeless as the desert—an ambiguous in-between: sparse grasses, uncertain waters, yet just enough to sustain the flocks.

Wolves had long claimed this terrain. Their sharp silhouettes flashed between rocks and moonlight, their eyes reflecting the panic of sheep. The first encounters were blood-soaked: sheep dragged into the dark, tribesmen forced to guard through the night, bows and stone spears clashing with the glint of wolf fangs by firelight. Skinned hides lay beside bloody traces where pawprints crossed at dawn.

Yet conflict was not eternal. Wolves discovered that the embers of human fire drove off deadlier predators; humans came to realize that a wolf’s howl foretold the approach of prowling hunters in the night. When the sheep lay sleeping in the glow of fire, wolf-shadows lingered at the edge—no longer only for the kill.

As years unfolded, man and wolf shifted from enmity into a blurred interdependence—foes and sentinels both; predators and companions at once. In the elders’ tales began to spread the saying of “the Twin Eyes of the Mountain Spirit”—one belonging to human caution, the other to lupine sharpness.

Thus, the tribe found its footing in the Hindu Kush. The footsteps of exiles pressed heavily into the valleys, yet in their weight lay the path to a deeper future.







**2. Westward Route → The Cold and Damp Lands of Europe**

From the eagle’s vantage, time rose and fell like the tide—days and seasons compressed into the span of a single breath. The exiled clans, pressing westward, drifted like driftwood carried from a river’s mouth, gradually swallowed by strange new lands.

They crossed barren plains and arrived at a land of chill and damp. The soil here sank into endless mire; grasses grew thick, yet no seeds fit for cultivation could be tamed. Spring rains poured down, summers were fleeting, autumn frosts struck suddenly, and winters buried the earth under crushing snow. Attempts at farming failed one after another: grains rotted in sodden ground, seedlings withered in the long, frozen nights.

Even the flocks faltered. The grasses were wet and meager, unlike the lush meadows of mountain valleys. Marshes trapped their hooves; soaked wool and mud-borne sickness spread among the sheep. Fires sputtered against the damp, unable to dry their garments. The cold seeped into the bone, eroding the will of the people.

Death came in succession. Infants’ cries were sharp yet short-lived in the icy dark. Mothers’ milk dried away. Hunters returned with game too scarce to sustain the clan. Elders’ whispers curled into mist above the fires, but no answer to survival could be found.

At last, many clans abandoned the effort. They turned their backs on the damp west, retracing their steps eastward toward the Hindu Kush. Those who returned bore dim eyes, yet they carried with them an unshakable truth:

**The wet, cold lands were no new Nile. They could not sustain a great tribe.**

From the heights, the eagle beheld their paths converging like rivers into mountains. Scattered streams of humanity flowing back together, gathering in the valleys of the Hindu Kush—planting the seeds of a future convergence.







**3. Northward Route → The Ural Steppes**

The eagle’s wings swept over endless plains, waves of grass stretching to the horizon. The tribes migrating northward began with high hopes: vast lands, abundant water and pasture, seemingly enough to sustain hundreds of clans.

Yet the vastness was an illusion. There was no black soil accumulated in river valleys, no stable water from moist mountains, and no self-sustaining oases. The steppes’ seasons were extreme: grasses grew wildly in summer but withered in the long, harsh winters. The sheep could thrive briefly, but when winter came, the pastures turned to gray-brown dead fluff, and hunger consumed the flocks faster than the wolves.

The tribe attempted to replicate oasis-style farming—but in vain. The soil was thin, moisture escaped quickly, and seeds sown under sun and storm withered and died. The repeated failures drove home a harsh truth: this vast land could never become a second Nile.

As death and famine struck in succession, the tribes were forced to retreat south. They dragged behind them battered carts and emaciated animals, crossing the grasslands and bending again toward the southern side of the Caucasus Mountains. There, messengers from the Hindu Kush relayed the direction of the fires, assuring them that in the eastern mountains, water, pasture, and life still awaited.

Thus, the scattered returnees, like seeds blown by wind and gathered by water, converged upon those mountains.






**The First Year of the Blackwater Era**

They came from the Nile wetlands,
carrying grains, carrying the songs of their ancestors,
believing that oases would reappear deep within the desert.
Yet time and again they stepped into deathlands,
and at the end of sand and salt,
they saw their kin turn into white bones and dust.

They came from the northern plains,
gazing at the endless waves of grass,
believing that vastness meant abundance.
But they did not know the cold of winter
ripped the flocks faster than a hundred wolves.
Seeds they sowed were stolen by the raging wind,
like promises scattered across the wilderness.

They came from the west,
sowing between mud and frost,
yet reaped only hunger and despair.
Footprints vanished from the frozen soil,
and clans dissolved in tears and famine.

—And so they returned.
Returning to the oases of Arabia,
returning to the plateaus of Iran,
only to find water scarce, capacity limited.
Narrow wells could not hold the overflowing clans.
They were refused, driven out,
forced to press onward,
under the shadows of mountains,
their eyes fixed on the highlands where snow and black soil coexisted.

The Hindu Kush—
the boundary of stone and fire,
the battlefield of wolves and sheep.

There,
wolves prowled,
yet one hungry gray shadow
lowered its head beside the fire,
accepting the bone cast by human hands.
From that moment, the covenant between man and dog
was forged amid firelight and wilderness.

There,
the sheep began to graze and migrate,
spring following green grass, summer climbing high slopes,
autumn returning to the valleys, winter guarding the foothills.
The flocks grew ever larger,
the shepherd’s flute flowed like rivers,
carrying hope across the pastures.

There,
the tribes no longer perished one by one,
but gathered together.
Copper veins lay bare in the mountains,
fires and hammer strikes roared through the night,
spearheads sharp, armor shining—
as if a second sun rose over the ridges.

Food stores gradually filled,
warriors’ arms grew strong,
the shaman’s songs echoed farther,
cradles swayed more often.
Marriage wove bloodlines together,
language blended the clans.
Here—the illusion of oases
collapsed completely,
and a new law of nomadism began to be written.

And so they said:
**“The Blackwater Era begins—its first year.”**

They gazed at the snow-capped mountains,
they looked down upon the Blackwater,
remembering the pain of exile,
and the green glimmer in the eyes of wolves.

And at this moment,
the plains, mountains, canyons, and valleys
were giving birth to a new civilization,
whose roots were not in oases,
but in migration and herding.
Its fire was not the blazing sun,
but the hammering of copper and iron.

**This is the beginning of Blackwater.**






### **Chapter Three: The Covenant of Wolves and Fire**

The Hindu Kush Mountains rose and fell in undulating waves, peaks stretching continuously, ranging from four to seven thousand meters above sea level. In the valleys, gentle slopes alternated with towering peaks, forming natural terraced pastures. During spring and summer, melting snow fed trickling streams, while the dark Blackwater flowed slowly and cold, carrying rich humus that nourished the fertile grasslands along its banks.

On the pastures, sheep grazed on tender new grass, followed closely by cattle, whose leftover stems returned nutrients to the soil. Herding dogs patrolled the periphery of the flocks, alert to gray wolves lurking on distant summits. Agile and silent, the wolves moved across rocks and meadows, occasionally letting out low growls, warning the tribe: this land was not only a human dwelling, but also a hunting ground coveted by wolves.

The climate was unpredictable: morning fog shrouded the valleys, nights were pierced by biting winds. Yet the highlands’ daily temperature swings and seasonal pastures made rotational grazing possible. The tribe learned to move their sheep across different altitudes, following the cycles of pasture renewal; the distribution of water sources and the flow of the Blackwater together shaped the rhythm of the grazing ecosystem. In these mountains, humans, sheep, cattle, and dogs formed a dynamic ecological network, each adapting to and balancing the others, gradually nurturing the nascent nomadic civilization of the Hindu Kush.

On the highlands of the Hindu Kush, the dogs were no longer mere companions—they became guardians of the flocks, “living sheep pens.” They circled the flocks, keenly detecting gray wolves hidden on the slopes, issuing low warning growls or quickly intercepting intruding predators.

The female chief and the shaman carefully observed their behavior: which breeds were brave, which cautious; which acted alone, which excelled in cooperation. They realized that the dogs not only protected the flocks but could influence the sheep’s movement patterns, allowing efficient rotational grazing between valleys and slopes.

Based on these observations, the tribe gradually established livestock–canine symbiosis rules: dogs were granted certain rights to food—their share included innards and bones; humans had to cook the edible portions before feeding the dogs, preventing the pack from turning feral and attacking humans or other dogs out of hunger. Through this system, humans and dogs built trust and collaboration, laying the foundation for future rotational grazing and large-scale pastoralism.






The tribe gradually mastered the patterns of elevation in the mountains, rotating their flocks along valleys and slopes: in spring, they descended to the river valleys to graze on fresh tender grass; in summer, they climbed to higher grounds to follow the newly grown pastures; in autumn, they returned to mid-altitude slopes to supplement with dry grass; and in winter, they sheltered in the relatively warmer lower valleys.

The shaman and the tribe members jointly recorded migration routes, pasture growth cycles, and water source locations, creating an ecological map combining oral memory with symbolic markings. This rotational grazing method kept the pastures in optimal feeding condition, allowed the soil to recover, and ensured sustainable use of mountain resources.

As the rotational grazing system became stable, the number of sheep gradually increased, enriching the tribe’s food supply. The tribe’s population carrying capacity improved, allowing more members to survive and reproduce, laying the groundwork for the great consolidation of the Hindu Kush tribes and the rise of nomadic civilization.

Tribal elders convened councils of female leaders to determine meat distribution rules: dogs were given priority for animal innards and bones, while humans received cooked meat. This allocation respected the dogs’ food rights and prevented them from turning excessively aggressive toward other tribe members out of hunger.

During daily grazing and hunting, the tribe trained the wolf packs through timed feeding and behavioral guidance, teaching them to forage near the fire rather than attack proactively. Over time, these gray wolves gradually “caninized,” becoming indispensable partners in the pastoral teams.

This system not only strengthened the human–dog symbiosis but also laid the foundation for expanded rotational grazing and large-scale tribal consolidation, making the nomadic civilization of the Hindu Kush more stable and sustainable.

Gray wolves began foraging near the fires, approaching humans without hostility. Initially considered coincidental, the tribe soon realized that these wolves could drive away unfamiliar invading packs at critical moments, protecting the sheep and the tribe.

The female chief and the shaman recognized that, if guided properly, this behavior could form a stable symbiotic relationship. Selective domestication began: controlling feeding, defining fixed boundaries around the fire, and observing social and territorial behaviors of the wolves.

This process of wolf–dog integration not only altered the ecological landscape but also shaped tribal culture: wolves were revered as mountain guardians, she-wolves symbolized the tribe’s matriarch, and gradually, they became part of the tribe’s mythology and daily rituals, reinforcing both the organizational structure and spiritual beliefs of the nomadic society.





**“The Blackwater Era: Song of the She-Wolf”**

Morning light first appears along the ridges; the Blackwater flows slowly,
Sheep tread on dew, grass tips glinting silver.
The fire crackles, smoke rising,
The female chief stands upon a rock, the shaman murmurs.

A gray shadow moves quietly, wolf eyes flashing green,
Driven by hunger, yet it does not attack.
It circles the fire, sniffing the scent of humans,
For the first time coexisting, destinies quietly entwined.

“Mother wolf, guard my people, watch over our mountains,
Teach my descendants to learn your wisdom and courage.”
The council sits in a circle, murmuring through the smoke,
Meat and bones are distributed, the first law established:
The wolf receives innards and bones, humans receive cooked meat,
A covenant of coexistence, etched into the valley.

The night wind howls, wolf shadows multiply,
Firelight reveals the round, flickering eyes of young wolves.
The shaman chants softly, ancient symbols crystallize:
Fire — source of life,
Wolf — guardian spirit,
Council — emblem of wisdom,
Ritual — mark of order.

As years flow, the valley echoes:
The she-wolf raises her young, teaching humans diligence and courage,
Stories passed by word of mouth, totems awaken minds,
Tribal culture takes root,
Wolf and human, bloodline and spirit dance together.









### **Chapter Four: The Complement of Sheep and Cattle**

In the early morning of the Hindu Kush mountains, a thin mist still clung to the valleys, dew glinting on the grass tips. The female chief, Nuwa, stood atop a high rock, her gaze sweeping over the sheep and cattle grazing on the slopes. The sheep moved like a white wave, nibbling only the tender grass within reach; the cattle were silent and steady, lowering their heads to eat the taller, tougher grass that sheep could not reach, transforming it into their own nourishment.

Nuwa turned to the shaman beside her, a thoughtful frown between her brows: “Shaman, although our sheep are many, each patch of grass seems covered with short vegetation, offering limited food throughout the year. With population growth already showing its pressure, can seasonal grazing still sustain us?”

The shaman lightly stroked his beard, eyes tracing the layered pastures across the valley: “Nuwa, the pastures are limited. Sheep only eat the low, tender grass, so their utilization is naturally restricted. The cattle appear and fill this ecological gap. They eat higher, tougher grass than sheep, which significantly improves the overall efficiency of pasture use.”

Nuwa crouched, her fingers brushing the soil pressed by cattle hooves: “But the cattle are large and strong, and the dog packs cannot fully herd or protect them. If they roam freely or feed at will, our grazing order will be disrupted. Will we lose control of the herd?”

The shaman nodded, eyes fixed on the cattle grazing in the distance: “Exactly. The tribe now faces a new challenge. Cattle are the key to ecological complementarity, but they also require regulation: we must study how to guide their behavior to coordinate coexistence with the sheep and dogs.”

Nuwa slowly stood, her voice firm: “Then we must act. We cannot rely solely on natural adaptation; we must establish new rotational grazing plans and food distribution systems, so sheep, cattle, and dogs each get their share, allowing the pasture ecosystem to support a larger population.”

The mountain wind swept through, rustling the grass as if echoing her words. Nuwa and the shaman exchanged a glance, a clear plan already forming in their minds: ecological complementarity was only the beginning; next, humans, dogs, sheep, and cattle must form a true cooperative network across the mountains.







Nuwa stood on the slope, bathed in the slanting morning light, gazing at the snow-capped peaks of the Tibetan Plateau in the distance. The wind swept through the thin mist and rustled the grass, as if reminding her of the challenges that lay ahead. She turned to the shaman and spoke in a low voice: “Shaman, our sheep and cattle have begun to form an initial complementarity, but the cattle are too large, and the dog packs cannot fully control them. We must attempt to domesticate larger breeds to assist in herding.”

The shaman pondered for a moment, then nodded slowly: “To the north of the mountains, on the Tibetan Plateau, there exist large canine species—strong, cold-resistant, and highly alert. If we can crossbreed them with our domestic dogs, we could gain true guardians for the herd.”

A decisive gleam flashed in Nuwa’s eyes: “More than that, we will begin a short-term highland grazing program. Each year, we will lead the tribe, along with the cattle, sheep, and dogs, to pastures at higher altitudes, allowing them to gradually adapt to the thin air and harsh cold.”

The shaman frowned: “The risks are great. At first, we may lose livestock and manpower.”

Nuwa smiled, her gaze firm: “Risk and opportunity go hand in hand. Only by letting the cattle, sheep, and large dogs grow in extreme environments can we accelerate the formation of cold- and high-altitude–resistant lineages. Every highland grazing expedition is a directed selection for the ecosystem, the livestock, and the tribe.”

By evening, the tribe brought out food and equipment from their tents. Nuwa instructed several young members to guide the dog packs in preparation for the next day’s highland migration. The dogs circled the sheep vigilantly, the cattle followed steadily, and the mountain wind swept past. In the distance, the snow-capped peaks gleamed, as if foreshadowing the journey and challenges to come.

Under Nuwa’s leadership, the tribe began annual short-term highland grazing. Through repeated practice, the pasture ecosystem, the physical condition of the cattle and sheep, and the adaptability of the large dogs were carefully recorded and optimized. Crossbreeding and domestication plans gradually unfolded, and a new pastoral order quietly took shape in the Hindu Kush mountains, laying the foundation for the highland civilization to come.






Night fell over the Hindu Kush mountains, and the firelight flickered against the rocky cliffs, casting the shadows of Nuwa and the tribal leaders. The tribe sat around the fire, the air filled with the aroma of roasting lamb and the crisp chill of the mountain wind. Nuwa rose, her voice cutting through the night: “Our tribe has not yet reached its population limit, nor have we fully explored the potential of these mountains. Now is the time to make strategic decisions.”

The shaman nodded slowly beside her: “The pastures, the cattle and sheep, and the dog packs have formed an initial order. Next comes choosing a direction, determining the fate of the tribe.”

During the council, each tribe voiced their opinions:

* **Nuwa proposed her plan:** “I will lead the tribe into the highlands for directed domestication. The highland environment is harsh, but cattle and sheep, along with large dogs that are cold- and low-oxygen–resistant, will become the foundation of our future strength.”

* **The northern Viking ancestors spoke:** “We propose moving west, occupying the northern Iranian plateau and the Caspian coastal corridors to secure trade and grazing routes. At the same time, we will cross the Caucasus Mountains and claim the grasslands west of the Urals, opening new pastures for the tribe.”

* **Other tribal leaders reported:** “We will handle logistics, stockpile food and weapons, protect trade routes, and ensure that migration and expansion proceed smoothly.”

The firelight danced across each determined face. The shaman whispered to Nuwa: “This time, it is no longer forced exile, but a conscious choice of the future. With clear roles, the tribe’s fate is in its own hands.”

Nuwa nodded, her gaze firm: “The embryo of a nomadic civilization is taking shape—highly organized, with clear divisions of labor. This means the tribe can survive, grow, and endure under wind, snow, and the shadows of wolves.”

Under the firelight, the Hindu Kush night seemed both tranquil and powerful. The distant snow-capped peaks appeared to foreshadow the proactive journey the tribe was about to undertake.








### *The Blackwater Era: Migration*

On the mountaintop, snow-capped peaks glistened with frost.
The pastures were just turning green, and the sheep grazed with bowed heads.
Shadows of wolves lurked nearby, while the firelight illuminated warriors and elders.
Nuwa stood on a rock, gazing into the distance, the shaman’s whispers recounting history in her ears:
“Our tribe has not yet reached its limit; wind, snow, and wolf shadows will witness our choices.”

Crossing the ridges, with thin air and biting cold,
cattle and sheep lowed in the frost,
while dog packs protected every step.
Short-term grazing recorded pasture growth and water sources,
survival of the fittest, genes selected by the cold wind.
By the fire on frozen nights, the she-wolf murmured softly,
its eyes reflecting the tribe’s future:
cold-hardy sheep, strong cattle, brave canine companions—
every life-or-death challenge reshaped their genes.
The tribe sang, and the snowfields echoed:
“Those who endure the winter will survive!”

To the north, the grasslands stretched endlessly,
winds swept yellow soil, rivers twisted,
wolves roamed along the edges.
The tribe rode camels and drove their cattle and sheep,
arrows and shields glinting in the sun,
gradually occupying prime pastures, expanding population reserves,
building temporary camps, storing food and weapons.
Every hunt, every defense, multiplied the tribe’s strength.
“The grasslands belong to the brave; the further the grazing song carries, the louder it echoes!”

Eastward and northward, two directions:
one to refine genes, the other to expand population.
Mountains and plains, wind, snow, and yellow sand—
humans, sheep, cattle, dogs, wolves—
coexistence and conquest intertwined, weaving the tapestry of a nomadic civilization.
Nuwa gazed far, the shaman whispered softly:
“The wind and snow will wash away the weak; the grasslands will nurture the strong.
Wolf shadows and firelight are our covenant.”

From the Hindu Kush to the snowy highlands,
from west of the Urals to the vast yellow sands,
the tribe’s steps meandered like rivers.
Civilization flowed with the wind, grew on the plains, and passed through the bloodline.
The song of migration echoed long:
“The living endure, the strong prevail; the grasslands and snowfields alike are the domain of our tribe.”






**Chapter Five: The Call of Kunlun**

The morning mist of the Hindu Kush had not yet lifted. Nuwa and the shaman stood on the ridge, gazing down at the tribe’s sheep slowly moving below, while the dogs kept vigilant watch on either side. In the distance, the shadow of a gray wolf flickered in and out of view, as though spying on these uninvited guests.

Nuwa’s eyes pierced through the layers of ridges toward the untamed highlands of the east.
“Shaman,” she said, “you once told me of the great dogs on the plateau—beasts of powerful bloodlines that could live alongside our sheep and cattle. That means we can accelerate the refinement of our stock, making our tribe hardier, more resistant to cold and thin air, stronger than before.”

The shaman slowly nodded, his gaze fixed on the snowy peaks of Tibet in the far distance.
“Yes, Nuwa. The plateau’s harsh ecology will give us an extreme testing ground for rotational grazing and selective breeding. Any sheep, cattle, or dogs that survive here will be the distilled essence of nature’s selection. A prolonged stay will strengthen the tribe’s very capacity to endure.”

Nuwa gripped her staff firmly, her tone resolute.
“If we succeed, it will mean more than survival. Every short-term grazing on the plateau will be a deliberate act of selection. Our sheep will grow hardier, our cattle more productive, our dogs fiercer. The tribe’s future will take root here.”

The shaman smiled faintly, but his voice was a warning:
“Risk is inescapable. The plateau is cold, the air thin, the diseases unknown. A vanguard must go first—marking water sources and pastures, studying the ways of the great plateau dogs. Understand, Nuwa: this is not only migration—it is a wager of our very blood against nature.”

Nuwa drew in a sharp breath of the icy mountain wind, the chill cutting to her bones.
“I understand. We will treat every grazing as an experiment, every stay as a trial. The plateau itself will decide who lives and who multiplies. Shaman, stand with me—let us prepare the plan and ready the tribe.”

The shaman bowed his head and chanted softly:
“On the snowy ridges, the wind will show us the way; in the shadow of the great dogs, the strong will be chosen. Nuwa, lead your people forward. They will remember your courage, and they will carry the strength that this land bestows.”

Nuwa turned to look at the bustling tribe: sheep winding along the slope, camels laden with supplies trudging forward, men and women adjusting tents and preparing provisions for the long march. Her voice rang clear through the morning mist:
“Tomorrow, we depart. Every step for the bloodline. Every step for the tribe’s future.”








**The Call of the Tibetan Plateau**

An eagle’s wings cleave morning haze,
Above the Hindu Kush the white flocks graze.
Ten fleeting years like arrows fly,
The tribe leaves tracks on ridge and sky.

Spring snows dissolve, the grasses rise,
The sheep march forth with measured strides.
The cattle crop what greens remain,
The dogs guard borders, wolves still feign.

Nüwa leads, the shaman prays,
Each camp a trial in nature’s ways.
Each fleeting stay, each brief domain,
Becomes a test of blood and strain.

Summer winds through stone peaks blow,
The vanguard seeks where waters flow.
Through rainy torrents rivers run,
Their maps are etched in everyone.

Autumn paints the slopes in gold,
With tents by cliffs the goods are rolled.
The flocks, the herds, the hounds grow strong,
Each march selects who still belongs.

Winter crowns the peaks with knives,
The thin air culls unfit of lives.
Yet those who last are forged anew,
The eagle wheels o’er lands they knew.

Through years of mountains, rivers vast,
The rocks and snows became their class.
The wolves turned dogs, the stock grew bold,
They learned to herd, to share, uphold.

At last they stand where sky meets land,
A sea of clouds beneath them spans.
Tianshan’s peaks to Mongol plains,
Sichuan’s basin in their gaze remains.

Nüwa turns, her people cheer,
Their sweat and tears to smiles adhere.
Her form ascends through snow peaks white,
The tribe now guards the earth with might.

The eagle folds its wings at last,
The winds erase time’s fleeting past.
The plateau’s breath, the tribe’s heartbeat,
As one they claim this world complete.









The eagle’s wings circled above the clouds,
and time itself seemed to hasten like the wind.
The tribe had only just set foot on the Tibetan Plateau.
The sky was thin, the cold winds howled,
and the pastures were still unfamiliar.
Yaks lowered their heads, testing the fresh grass.
Tibetan sheep slowly adapted to the brief alpine meadows.
Mastiffs prowled among the rocks, sniffing,
their lupine instincts not yet fully tamed.

On a high slope, Nüwa spoke softly with the shaman:

> “The water is unevenly scattered,
> the grazing lands are fragmented.
> We must record every terrain
> suitable for herding.”
>
> “Send out four expeditions—east, northeast, due north, northwest.
> Map the land, the grasses, the waters, and the hidden threats.
> Only by knowing our borders can we set the paths of migration.”

The expeditions departed:

* **Eastern Route**: through deep valleys, tracing rivers and plants, recording the density of meadows and the cycles of their seasonal growth.
* **Northeastern Route**: along the great river basin, surveying water and pasture quality, while watching for dangers and natural barriers.
* **Northern Route**: into the edges of the Mongolian steppe, observing vast grasslands and wild herds, attempting first trials of pasturing.
* **Northwestern Route**: across the Tianshan range, noting the veins of ore, the spread of meadows, and the feasibility of crossing deserts.

Day after day, year after year,
yaks, sheep, and mastiffs, under the tribe’s guidance,
slowly adapted to the cold and the thin air of the highlands.
The herds’ behavior was still unsettled.
Mastiffs and wolves clashed at times,
yet the tribe kept watching, intervening, recording their patterns—
building experience for the future work of deliberate domestication.

High above, the eagle soared, surveying the plateau.
Time was compressed into images of years:
exploration, trial grazing, record-keeping, adaptation—
together forming the tribe’s first knowledge of the plateau’s ecology.
They had not yet reached the summit of achievement,
but they had mastered the rhythms of survival.
In this cadence lay the foundation for coming years
of expansion and the weaving of resources into unity.







After years of highland pasturing and the domestication of yaks, Tibetan sheep, and mastiffs,
the tribe finally stabilized its ecological system.
Meanwhile, the expeditions brought back reports from all directions:

* **Northwest Route — Altai Mountains**

  * Rich copper deposits were discovered, sufficient for bronze production and the stockpiling of weapons.
  * A shimmering ore was found by chance, at first thought to be an impurity of copper, and called “false copper.”
  * After repeated smelting attempts, it was clear that this mineral could not yield bronze and had no practical function—yet its brilliance was striking.
    The tribe named it **shar**, meaning *“the glittering thing.”*
    A few years later, for easier cross-cultural exchange, it gained a secondary name, **Asilis**,
    entering the tribal worldview as a *“non-strategic rare mineral.”*

* **Eastern Route — Sichuan Basin**

  * Vast fertile farmland and human groups were found, suitable for localized agriculture and limited trade contacts,
    though geography made large-scale migration difficult.
  * The expedition brought back knowledge of local resources and artifacts,
    providing a basis for barter and resource acquisition.

The tribe began using **copper** for weapons, tools, and bronze ornaments,
while also experimenting with **waste utilization**:
*shar* was fashioned into jewelry, adornments, and trade tokens.
Its gleam became a symbol of value in intercultural exchange rather than a tool of utility—
thus laying the foundations of an early form of **international currency**
between the Tibetan Plateau tribes and surrounding civilizations.

* **Pastoral Rotation and Colonial Layout**

  * The northern Mongolian steppe was designated for semi-nomadic grazing, securing long-term herds and provisions.
  * The Junggar Basin adopted a mixed model of mining and herding,
    where copper and *shar* were processed in concentration.
  * Through a carefully designed exchange system,
    the tribe traded the glittering stones with the Sichuan Basin and the Iranian oasis civilizations,
    establishing a stable network of supply and demand.








#### **Dialogue in the Kunlun Mountains: The Khatun and the New Shaman**

The light of dusk spread across the snowline and meadows of the Tibetan Plateau,
the wind carrying with it the chill of thin air.
Nüwa sat upon a boulder on the towering ridge, her gaze sweeping across the vast highland.
Below, the herds wandered freely; Tibetan mastiffs guarded yaks and sheep,
and the wind intermingled with the howls of wolves.

The new shaman approached slowly, staff in hand, his demeanor reverent:
“Mother of the Earth, Khatun.”

Nüwa smiled faintly, her eyes piercing the distant sea of clouds:
“Khatun? So… that is the name you give me.”

The shaman bowed deeply:
“It is you who led the people to survive and multiply in this realm above the clouds,
who shaped the order of ecology, beasts, and humankind.
You are the Mother of the Highlands—beneath your feet all things are sheltered and guided.”

Nüwa extended her hand toward the distant mountains and valleys:
“From here, one can see it all—rivers, pastures, veins of ore…
everything that sustains our tribe.
Every path, every blade of grass, bears the weight of our choices and our labor.”

The shaman spoke softly:
“Khatun, we shall name this mountain range after you—the **Kunlun Mountains**.
From this day, the gods (our stronghold) dwell in the heavens (the plateau);
envoys shall go forth from Kunlun,
and from here the tribe will marshal resources, govern colonies, and carry forward your wisdom.”

Nüwa nodded, stroking the Tibetan mastiff at her side:
“The thin air and cold of this highland force people, beasts, and plants alike to adapt.
This is nature’s selection, and also our trial.
Through decades of risk, we have mastered rotational grazing,
the taming of giant dogs, the domestication of yaks and Tibetan sheep.
Our institutions and our ecology have evolved together,
and the tribe has quickened its genetic adaptation through hardship.”

The shaman raised his eyes to the horizon, his voice filled with reverence:
“Khatun, Kunlun and the Great Dogs shall become the symbols of our culture, binding us together.
The resources and ecological strengths of the highlands shall be our strategic reserve,
sustaining the expansion of our future civilization.”

Nüwa sighed gently, her gaze both soft and resolute:
“From this day forth, the Tibetan Plateau shall be our heaven.
The people will know—this is the root of our survival,
and the point of departure for our journeys into the world.
The Kunlun Mountains shall guide our future.”

The mountain winds roared, snowflakes lifted into the air,
and the figures of Nüwa and the shaman stood against the sea of clouds—
the Khatun reigning from Kunlun, governing the heavens,
while envoys depart from Kunlun.






### **Sanxingdui beneath the Golden Shadow**

The glittering shards came from distant mountains,
fragments of gold-plated bronze armor,
shining in the palms of nomadic tribes,
useless in craft, yet kindling fire in the eyes.

The natives of the Sichuan Basin gazed,
from youth to elder, desire stirred within.
They rushed to pursue, offering grain and cloth,
to trade for that illusory brilliance—
as addicts chasing the sparks of flame.

Armor-born culture seeped through streets and alleys;
families competed, flaunted, and contended.
Golden masks, gilded bronze shields
became emblems of rank and power—
their value not in use, but in vanity’s mirror.

Yet excess could not flow without bounds.
Wise elders of the tribes arose,
each year collecting objects of lavish display,
burying them deep in the earth,
turning them into a silent river underground.

The years passed, gold was swallowed by soil;
masks lay still in the dark loam.
The vanity once burning returned to silence,
and those glittering shards,
became a riddle for later ages—
the ruins of Sanxingdui:
golden shadows buried,
yet still reflecting the soul of civilization.








### *The Trade of the Golden Wind*

The wind sweeps ridges of Hindu Kush high,
Bronze-furnace flames in Nuwa’s eye.
Ore from the mountains glitters bright,
Yet false bronze gleams with fleeting light.
She names it **shar**—the shining guise,
A useless spark before her eyes.

Plated masks and jewels it made,
Nomad hooves in caravan parade.
Westward they press, through plateau wide,
O’er Iran’s heights, through deserts dry,
Through oases green and storm-worn vale,
Where sand and wind their trails assail.

Gold brings no food, nor weapon’s might,
Yet hearts succumb to its blinding sight.
Queens and chiefs, and sages, too,
Merchants eager, chasing the new—
Pouring wealth for the glittering stone,
Desire’s whirlpool, endless, unknown.

On Nile’s wetland, the sails rise proud,
The **shar** is borne through storm and cloud.
For grain, for cloth, for ivory white,
For spice that burns with secret light.
Nomads watching from plateaus afar,
See value drift like wind on par.
The first world coin begins its reign,
A worthless spark turned global chain.

Bronze-blades sharp, and cattle’s tread,
Faith and wealth in the high wind wed.
Dogs keep watch, while trade takes form,
In flashing waste, the world was born.








### *The Road of Eagle Hooves*

The cold winds of Altai howl along the ridge,
Eyes of the khatuns pierce beyond the snowline’s edge.
Eagle wings flicker through valley and sky,
Messengers of the tribes in dawnlight sigh:
“Go forth, with talons, seek the shimmer of oasis water.”

The eagle soars above Tarim’s vast dome,
Oases like stars in the desert’s loam.
Each beat of the wing, a signal of trade,
Each sudden dive, a pathfinder’s blade.

Hooves shatter the winter snow, scrape frozen grass,
Cattle and sheep chew life as storms pass.
Long migrations are no longer mere toil,
But bloodlines etched in routes across the soil.

On the northern Eurasian steppe, horses race like the breeze,
Plains, rivers, highlands are stamped with their keys.
In central Tarim, markets and wells entwine,
Eagles and camels pierce the desert’s spine.

Southward they move to the Tibetan heights,
To Sichuan’s green valleys, to fertile lights.
Each traded good is a craft, a lore,
Each caravan road is kinship’s core.

From East Asia to Nile’s floodplain,
Steppe, oasis, wetland sustain.
The end of one trade, another begun,
**Shar**’s bright gleam, bronze, herds, and spun cloth run.
Through wind, snow peaks, and river gorge sweep,
Like eagle eyes and hoofbeats weaving deep,
A moving map the world became,
A living thread, a timeless flame.

Khatuns gaze from the high plateau crest,
Eagles circle the heavens, hooves pound the rest.
Order arises from trade and migration,
Civilization grows at the snow-sand-grass-river’s junction.
Eagles and horses, bronze and gold,
Sheep, cattle, and people in stories retold—
Together they carved the first great road,
A true transcontinental trade abode.








### *Chronicle of the Black Waters · Pursuing the Horse*

**Prologue**

Between the Tibetan Plateau and the high mountains,
rivers flow in a slow descent, their waters dark brown,
heavy as the night itself—these are the Black Waters.

Such rivers mostly spring from the sluggish thaw
of permafrost and seasonal frost.
Snowmelt carries silt and humus,
drifting through low-lying valleys in quiet streams.
In this cold realm, the remains of animals and plants,
fallen branches, leaves, and dung,
decompose with extreme slowness,
settling in riverbeds and banks as dense brown sludge,
staining the water with an almost ink-black hue.

The Black Waters are not only emblems of the land’s fertility,
but also rivers of time:
their sluggish currents seal within them
ecological traces of centuries, even millennia.
They record the thin air,
the cold, and the pressure of daily survival
on the plateau of Tibet,
and they bear witness to the long companionship
of nomadic peoples with cattle, sheep, and dogs.

Along the banks of the Black Waters,
mosses, meadows, and wetland plants
burst into a fleeting life each summer,
drawing herds of sheep and cattle to graze,
and in turn feeding raptors and wolves.
The slowness and the darkness of the water
symbolize the accumulation and secrecy of highland civilizations:
material wealth, lived experience, and wisdom—
all settle like humus in the riverbed,
providing nomads with resources
and with the genetic room to adapt and endure.

The Black Waters are the bloodstream of the earth,
a confluence of time and ecology,
witness to migrations, to domestication,
to risk and adventure.
They run through the long history
from the early wanderings of nomadic civilization
to its gradual clash with political structures.
This is the core symbol of the *Chronicle of the Black Waters*.







Since the occupation of the Tibetan Plateau and the domestication of horses in Central Asia, the herders and nomadic tribes across Afro-Eurasia began to connect slowly through trade and migration. Horses became the central link: although saddles had not yet been invented and mounted combat was impossible, they served as vital tools for long-distance transport, forming the foundation for the exchange of resources and populations across great distances.

The techniques of horse domestication spread westward along the steppe networks. Beyond the Ural Mountains, the ancestors of the Vikings acquired horses through steppe trade routes, using them for commerce and migration. Because their contact with Western Asia was limited, their skin tones and hair colors remained largely light—blond hair and blue eyes became their defining traits. By contrast, the nomads of the Altai, through trade, raiding, and frequent migrations, developed a high degree of genetic mixing; within the same cultural groups, differences in skin color and hair color were pronounced.

In the Nile Valley, civilizations of this period invented the chariot, which enabled the rapid spread of horse use in agriculture and transport. This innovation localized the long-range transport capacity of Central Asian herders, making it possible to move grain, livestock, and precious metals across long distances.

Population movement and intermarriage became a key mechanism of steppe civilization. A single herder could, within a year, travel west of the Urals, bring back a partner as a wife, and thereby establish kinship and alliance networks across tribes and cultures. Such high mobility not only accelerated the spread of culture and technology but also subtly shaped the genetic profiles and physical features of the entire steppe region.

In this way, the Eurasian steppe produced two characteristic human patterns:

1. **The relatively isolated Northern European groups**: low rates of admixture, with distinct light skin, blond hair, and blue eyes.
2. **The highly mobile Central Asian and Altai groups**: frequent intermixing, diverse skin and hair colors, yet bound together by a unified nomadic culture and trade network.

The essence of this period lay in **the connectivity of transport tools and trade nodes**. This not only diversified the lives of pastoralists but also laid the demographic, ecological, and technological foundations for later social institutions, economic systems, and strategies of war.







Cold winds swept across the vast steppes west of the Ural Mountains. The long-settled snow had melted, revealing yellow-brown earth beneath. The ancestors of the Vikings led their herds of horses, moving slowly along the Central Asian trade routes. Their animals were tall and strong, yet still unfit for riding; they could only carry fodder, furs, and bronze goods. Each spring, the tribes set out, following the steppe paths toward distant valleys and oases, trading livestock, grain, and handmade crafts with other clans.

In the northwestern Altai Mountains, eagles were tamed and became the tribes’ eyes—circling high above the peaks, spotting oases, water sources, and pastures. Horses then hauled these resources swiftly back to the camps, ensuring survival through the brutal winters. Each returning caravan carried not only goods from faraway oases but also news of other peoples—and often brides from foreign clans, weaving new ties of marriage, alliance, and kinship.

Across Central Asia, herders sat by the fires in winter, watching the snow beneath their horses’ hooves and discussing the hardiness of yaks, Tibetan sheep, and mastiffs brought from the Tibetan Plateau. Their skin had gradually lightened under the northern winds and the high-altitude sun. Yet in the Altai, constant migration and exchange made hair and eye color diverse—blue and brown eyes, blond and black hair intermingling—while the tribe still preserved the same nomadic order.

Far to the south, the sun scorched the golden sands of the Nile wetlands. Caravans arrived bearing Central Asian horses, bronzeware, and news of copper mines. Valley craftsmen marveled at the massive beasts from distant lands. With chariots, they carried grain and building materials farther than before, linking villages along the riverbanks into networks. Each chariot, each horse, stood as a symbol of the slow yet steadfast ties between peoples and civilizations.

Over the long centuries, the trade networks stretched wider, like trails of hoofprints across the grasslands. Each market became the starting point of the next journey; each intermarriage, an exchange of bloodlines and culture. The pale skin, blond hair, and blue eyes of the Viking forebears contrasted with the mixed features of the Central Asian and Altai nomads—but all were bound together by horses, trade, and migration.

Through millennia of wind and snow, dust and rivers, plains and mountains, the very framework of Eurasian nomadic civilization took shape: horses carried commerce, eagles guarded oases, herds adapted to the highland winds, and people—through marriage, exchange, and alliance—were firmly bound together. Without saddles, without conquest, the true strength of civilization grew quietly in this slow, enduring web of interconnection and adaptation.








Long before horses were domesticated on the Tibetan Plateau and Central Asian trade hubs were established, northern tribes had already begun probing into the far Arctic lands. They traveled northward across the vast Siberian steppe, crossed the Bering land bridge, and entered the Americas—a continent yet untouched by permanent human settlement. While the land bridge still existed, the traditions of migration, hunting, and even the earliest forms of nomadism quietly passed into the New World alongside both people and animals.

When the Ice Age ended and sea levels rose, the Bering land bridge sank beneath the waters, severing direct contact between North America and Asia forever. Yet the nomadic wisdom, the symbiotic way of life with animals, and the adaptability to long-distance migrations had already been planted deep within the cultures of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas—seeds of knowledge and experience that would later flourish in their hunting and herding practices.






The cold winds of the Tibetan Plateau still howled across the heights, while beneath the plateau—among the steppes, mountains, and oases of Eurasia—the political order of nomadic tribes quietly took shape. Here, authority did not rest on kinship; after three generations, blood ties thinned like fading streams. Instead, the bonds of family and tribe were upheld through oaths, intermarriage, and long-standing trade networks.

As mining, trade, and raiding grew in importance, new structures of power emerged: men came to command the arteries of the economy—those who controlled mines, herds of horses, and trade routes wielded authority that far surpassed the limited population of the plateau homeland. Yet supreme leadership within each tribe was shared by husband and wife. The wife, representing the Tibetan Plateau, not only oversaw internal affairs but also became the keystone of alliances, using wisdom and patience to balance the delicate ties between colonies and the homeland.

Though the colonies had long surpassed the plateau in population and resources, the harsh climate, thin air, and bitter cold made the highlands uninhabitable for soldiers, discouraging any attempt to overthrow the motherland’s authority. Thus, despite its sparse population, the Tibetan Plateau remained an unassailable strategic center.

In this period, male leaders who controlled gold mines fashioned a new title in echo of the matriarch’s: from the exalted honorific of the plateau’s *Khatun* arose the masculine title *Khan*. Through negotiation and oath, the tribes conferred upon the plateau’s *Khatun* the reverse title *Queen Mother*—the Mother of All Kings—affirming her as the highest authority among colonies and tribes alike. To preserve the fragile balance of power and prevent the colonies from declaring independence, the Tibetan Plateau in turn enfeoffed the supreme chieftain of the Altai colonial confederation as the *Golden Khan* (the Altai Khan). This act not only reinforced ethnic cohesion but also forged the concept of a Golden Lineage: economic, political, and military authority balanced under dual rule of husband and wife, yet always oriented around the plateau as the core.

Thus, across these ten millennia, power loosened its bonds with blood, marriage became a political instrument, and colonies and homeland were bound through trade and arms. Division of labor sharpened, populations swelled, and together environment and custom molded the earliest forms of steppe civilization and the golden economy that was yet to come.






During the nomadic tribes’ migration north of Lake Baikal, they encountered local inhabitants strikingly different from their ancestors. These groups had not continued the nomadic traditions of old: they had neither domesticated horses nor employed dogs to assist in herding. Instead, they relied on river fishing, forest hunting, valley pastoralism, and even the domestication of wild boars into pigs. The land was rich in water and grass, its rivers interwoven, and Lake Baikal itself held more than one-fifth of the planet’s fresh water reserves—resources so abundant that they had no need to wander ceaselessly as the nomads once did.

When the pioneers of the nomadic tribes arrived, they expressed disdain for these people: Why abandon the efficient lifeway of their forebears—symbiosis with dogs and the mastery of vast herds through only a few hands? Why forsake nomadism in favor of repetitive herding and fishing? Out of such scorn and reproach, the nomads gave the inhabitants a name: **“Tungus,”** meaning *“swineherds.”* The term pointed directly to their chief means of production while also marking them, in nomadic eyes, as having “betrayed the ancestral way.”

From that time onward, “Tungus” came to denote not only the inhabitants of that river basin but also, in later records, the defining character of the people themselves: industrious and settled, reliant on abundant waters and grasses, yet divorced from the nomadic wisdom of dog and horse symbiosis—the art of achieving more with less.






From the Tungus River basin stretching to the Greater Khingan Range and the East Asian coastal regions, vast forests, winding mountains, crisscrossing rivers, numerous lakes, and sinuous coastlines intertwined to form a complex landscape. In such an environment, the lifestyle of nomadic tribes was naturally constrained: wide grasslands gradually vanished, and horses, cattle, and sheep could no longer sustain large-scale migrations. The pastoral economy, once reliant on animal symbiosis, was forced to shift toward sedentary herding and agricultural practices.

This transformation was often not voluntary. Tribes that failed in resource competition were compelled to abandon their nomadic traditions, while landless or impoverished groups cleared fields and gradually established semi-sedentary or fully sedentary villages. Highly mobile communities began taking root in river valleys and coastal plains, bringing changes to their daily rhythms, social structures, and technological practices.

In the early stages, when populations were sparse and resources abundant, trade between nomadic and semi-sedentary groups could still maintain relative harmony: exchanges of horses, furs, minerals, and food created mutually beneficial networks. But as populations grew and social specialization deepened, competition for land, hunting grounds, rivers, and coastal resources became inevitable. Friction and conflict grew more frequent, and cultural differences between sedentary and non-sedentary groups accumulated tension, sowing the seeds for future political structures and ethnic conflicts.






The most prosperous tribal confederations of the Tungusic language family were distributed across the Greater Khingan Range. This region was characterized by seasonal permafrost, with a slow-moving, winding river darkened by abundant humus. Initially, in the tribes’ oral tradition, this river was simply called **Ruoshui (Weak Water)**, emphasizing its sluggish flow, which posed no threat to migrating communities.

As populations grew and tribal alliances expanded, Weak Water gradually acquired new significance. In shamanic narratives, it was renamed **Heishui (Blackwater)**: Blackwater symbolized the lifeblood of the earth, the source that nurtured all living things, and a representation of order and authority. Tribal leaders and priests repeatedly reinforced this conception through ritual, turning the river into not just a geographic feature but a political emblem of tribal identity.

Later, with the constant reshuffling of conflicts and alliances, the narrative became further politicized. Blackwater was transformed into **Heilongjiang (Black Dragon River)**. The dragon image did not originate from any real creature but evolved from earlier totems: the original “Jade Pig-Dragon” was misinterpreted as a serpent during interregional exchanges, eventually merging with tribal lore and being elevated to the symbolic dragon. Heilongjiang thus ceased to be merely a river; it became a sacred emblem that unified the tribe, symbolizing both a frontier barrier and a source of life for the nascent polity.

Through this progressive renaming, one can clearly see how the narrative was gradually politicized: from the natural **Weak Water**, to the religiousized **Blackwater**, and finally to the symbol of ultimate authority, **Black Dragon River**.

As for the term “Tungus,” in the pastoral language it originally meant “land where wild boars roam (Tungus / Land of Wild Boars).” The designation carried a derogatory sense, applied to groups that abandoned nomadic traditions and settled between forests and rivers. Discriminated against, expelled from the Tungus River region, and deprived of Baikal Lake’s fisheries, these people were forced into political reforms, gradually forming some of the earliest tribal alliances that attempted independent governance.







As time slowly passed, the nomadic tribes continuously transported the glittering gold of the Altai Mountains and the pure, translucent jade of the Tianshan Mountains eastward to East Asia, exchanging them for food, handcrafted tools, and artisanal techniques. The pastoral communities of East Asia did not succumb to extravagant displays of wealth; instead, they refined the gold and jade and resold them to the nomads, gaining both profit and resources. They carved the jade into various abstract toys and ritual objects, the most famous of which was the **Jade Pig-Dragon**—an elongated, lively figure resembling a little pig. Originally intended as a simple child’s toy, it gradually acquired cultural significance through repeated circulation and interregional trade.

When this figure traveled via trade to Egypt and was misinterpreted as a serpent symbol, it had already diverged from its original purpose and form, becoming a new emblem. Generations later, as the Jade Pig-Dragon returned to East Asia through cultural exchange, its serpentine body was progressively extended and abstracted, eventually evolving into the early form of the **Chinese dragon**—a symbol that intertwined primitive toys, animal forms, trade networks, and cultural cognition. Trade, the passage of time, and cultural flows quietly shaped a transcontinental symbolic system, while the jade economy became a crucial link sustaining the interaction between nomadic and pastoral civilizations.





When the nomadic tribes sent gold and white jade eastward, they did not realize the transformative potential unfolding. In the past, gold mining and jewelry production had been almost entirely monopolized by the colonial outposts of the Altai Mountains in Central Asia, making the trade network stable and predictable. Yet far to the east, among the pastoral tribes of the Greater Khingan Range, wealth was not passively received—they actively demanded access to raw jade.

The white jade, once cut, became fragile, impossible to rework, and lacked any sparkling sheen—its value lay not in utility, but in symbolism and creativity. The nomads failed to perceive this subtle “alienation.” Clearly, the pastoral tribes were quietly evolving, extending their focus from material goods to art and culture: jade became central to the production of cultural craft, gradually embedded in marriage and ritual, and eventually symbolizing female gifts.

Through this process, the pastoral tribes constructed an entirely new “monetary system”: a circulating medium that was single-use, fragile, and maintained value through cultural symbolism. Gold remained hard currency, but jade ornaments—fragile, non-reusable, and carrying social significance—became experimental instruments of a distinct economic mechanism, opening new paths for cultural and economic innovation within East Asian pastoral civilizations.








The eagle was the messenger of Eternal Heaven, Tengri—soaring through the skies, it descended as the first shaman among men. The shaman, in direct communion with divine will, heralded a new concept: Eternal Heaven, Tengri, seeping into the realm of politics and culture. At this moment, the pastoral tribes of the imperial frontier were recast within religious narrative: myth proclaimed Eternal Heaven Tengri as the Heavenly Father, who together with the Earth Mother, the Khatun, gave birth to all living things.

Yet this mythology was, in essence, a reform of politics and religion. Matrilineal clans were gradually marginalized, while patriarchal clan society rose in their place, empowered by both faith and authority. The Khatun, symbol of the Earth Mother, had already been challenged by the Altai colonies through the very invention of the title *Khan*. But once Eternal Heaven Tengri was imagined, he was placed above the Earth Mother, establishing himself as the supreme authority—thus displacing the original power center of the Tibetan Plateau in the narrative order.

Religion, then, did not merely shape belief; it rewrote political structures. The authority of the motherland was overshadowed by mythic patriarchal symbols, the balance of power between tribes and colonies was redefined, and politics and religion mirrored one another—mythic narrative and institutional innovation intertwining across the steppes and highlands.








### *Blackwater Hymn*

**Black is the water, slow as a vein,**
It winds through the earth, through marrow and grain.
It is the order, the tribal decree,
The law of the land, where the clans may be.

**Yellow is sand, a color confined,**
Winds sweep the desert, erase humankind.
All tribes that bear this captive hue,
Are bound as servants, bent and subdued.

**Blue is the sky, the breath of the free,**
Forests stretch shadows beneath its sea.
Those who depart from the steppe’s embrace,
Raise this banner, their guiding grace.

**White is the metal, fire-refined,**
It gleams with wealth, with power aligned.
He who commands the mines of stone,
Forges a throne that is purely his own.

**Red is the flame, the border of fate,**
It burns the wood, the altar it shapes.
The bear’s skull cracks in the sacred pyre,
Blood on the stones becomes god’s desire.

In the blaze, the **eagle descends from on high,**
Messenger of Eternal Sky.
It takes the form of the shaman first,
Breathes out storms, with heaven conversed.

Thus the tale of the Earth-Mother is torn,
The Khatun remains, yet her crown is worn.
The chieftain of eagles, feathers his crown,
At the bear-fire altar, he lays his vow down.
The drum of the shaman speaks in his stead,
Through him, the Father of Heaven is said.

From then, Blackwater is more than a stream,
It is law, it is chain, it is trumpet’s scream.
All tribes in ritual bow their head,
For a new order binds heaven and stead:
**Throne and altar joined as one,**
The eagle’s clan, beneath the sun,
Holds the voice of Eternal Sky,
And crowns the tribes where blood runs dry.









# Chapter One: The Pillar of the World

## *Hymn of the World Pillar*

Black is water, slow as the pulse,
flowing between grasslands and valleys.
It is order, the witness of covenant.
Yellow is sand, imprisoned by the wind,
reminding the tribe: the wanderer, the rootless,
shall in the sands forget his name.

Sky-blue is the heavens,
sheltering the galloping herdsmen,
free as the eagle, free as the wind,
unfolding in the endless breath of the steppe.
White is metal, awakened in fire,
forged into blades, forged into oaths,
the chieftain’s staff, the shaman’s bell.

Red is flame,
burning upon the altar of the bear,
the shaman whispers in eagle feathers,
his tongue the tongue of Eternal Heaven,
his shadow the shadow of Mother Earth.

—Thus,
upon the snowy ridges of the Tibetan Plateau,
the World Pillar was raised.

It pierced the clouds,
bridging the breath of Father Tengri and Mother Earth.
Blood of ice and snow coursed through its veins,
becoming the Yellow River, the Yangtze, the Ganges,
surging, nourishing steppe and oasis.

Dogs barked and their voices echoed on the plateau,
sheep slept peacefully on grassy slopes,
cattle moved slowly, like the heartbeat of the earth,
while horses leapt suddenly,
binding the steppe into one.

From Altai to the Hindu Kush,
from Tianshan to the Greater Khingan Range,
from the Black Waters
to the deep lake of Baikal,
countless tribes wandered here, met here, parted here.

Gold was born from the mountains,
white jade gleamed in the river valleys.
They traveled the horse roads of ten thousand li,
traded for salt, grain, tools, fire—
traded for poetry, for song,
for the rhythm of the shaman’s drum,
resonating with heaven and earth.

In those years before the cold descended,
Eurasia was like a hide unrolled.
The north wind only whispered,
the grasslands spread without end.
Alliances and marriages of tribes wove a net of order.
No one dared call himself orphan,
for all drank beneath the World Pillar,
from the same snow-fed waters.

—This was the abundance before silence fell,
the light before polar night and volcanic ash veiled the sun.
This was the great design of the nomads:
they took animals as totems,
colors as their law,
and inscribed between heaven and earth
the first poem of power and order.






* **Time**: After dawn, when the sky is faintly lit.
* **Place**: At the edge of the steppe, rolling hills, with horse herds moving slowly in the distance.
* **Characters**:

  * **Khatun** (young, a newly appointed female tribal leader, filled with doubt and anxiety).
  * **Shaman** (elder, thinker, political advisor—versed in both religion and politics, speaks in allegory and metaphor).

---

The wind swept across the steppe.
Far away, the breath and hoofbeats of horses drifted faintly.
Khatun walked alone on the high ground, an aged shaman following by her side.
The sky was gray-blue, like an unfinished painting.

**Khatun** (pensive, opening with “meaning”):

> “We roam the steppe for the sake of cattle, sheep, and horses.
> But when I wake in the night, I ask myself—why do our steps never rest?
> Is the meaning of life merely to keep our people from starving?”

**Shaman** (smiling, not answering directly):

> “Look at the herds.
> They migrate without end, they graze, they drink, they breed.
> They never ask *why*—that is why they are horses.
> You asked this question; therefore you are no longer horse, but human.”

**Khatun**:

> “But why then must humans, too, endlessly pursue?
> If meaning is only survival, are we truly better than beasts?”

**Shaman** (pausing, pointing to the horizon where two worlds meet):

> “The settled folk—they have houses, granaries, writing.
> Their meaning is *order*—to keep the fire alive in one place.
> They can pass inventions and tools to their children.
> But the price is the loss of freedom of movement.
> They grow rigid.”

**Shaman** (turning back toward the steppe):

> “We, on the other hand—follow water and grass.
> Our gift is *breakthrough*—for nothing binds us.
> New weapons, new riding, new ideas are always born at the frontier.
> But we are also fleeting—one gust of wind, and we scatter.”

**Khatun** (with dawning insight):

> “So both they and we are incomplete.
> Settlers can mass-produce; nomads can innovate.
> If joined together, could they not form a stronger civilization?”

**Shaman** (shaking his head, with layered meaning):

> “If joined as one, difference disappears, and so does tension.
> A bowstring cut cannot shoot an arrow, however sharp.
> True order requires that different meanings coexist—
> but never mix.”

**Khatun** (softly, almost to herself):

> “Coexist… but never mix.”

The wind rose, the grass swayed, and the horse herds surged forward—
as though annotating their dialogue.








**Khatun** (gazing at the distant horizon, speaking slowly):

> “You say the steps of nomads are like the wind, drifting across all lands.
> But I ask—what does such wandering truly bring to the world?
> We are merely moving from one pasture to another.”

**Shaman** (raising a hand toward the sky, where clouds drift):

> “The wind blows across mountains and rivers, carrying seeds.
> The steps of nomads are also wind.
> We are not just for cattle and sheep, but the spark connecting distant lands.
> Remember? Horses were first tamed in Central Asia, yet they bloomed into chariots in Egypt.
> Those were nomadic footsteps carrying the horse; yet settled hands combined wood and bronze to build the vehicle.”

**Khatun**:

> “So, without us, the horse would remain on the steppe;
> without them, the horse could never pull a chariot.”

**Shaman** (nodding):

> “Exactly. We open the nodes; they mass-produce the results.
> Thus culture, knowledge, and technology flow across distances.
> Bow and arrow, iron, wheel, writing… each is the fruit of repeated journeys, repeated exchanges.”

**Khatun** (reflecting):

> “Then the meaning of a person, the meaning of a tribe—does it lie within these things?
> If we merely eat, drink, and reproduce, we are no different from beasts.
> But when we tame animals, choose the strongest horse;
> when we improve seeds, select the richest grain;
> when we invent new weapons and tools…
> only then do we transform mere existence into meaning.”

**Shaman** (with far-reaching gaze, voice low):

> “Meaning is not in whether we live, but in what we leave behind.
> Every technological advance is an extension of the soul.
> Look at that foal—it runs simply to run;
> yet when humans place a bridle upon it, it becomes part of our civilization.
> And humans themselves—are we any different?”

The wind rises; the horses gallop.

**Khatun**:

> “Why do our tribal songs praise the gods, while the rituals of settled people are full of ghosts and grudges?”

**Shaman**:

> “Because we who follow horses need courage;
> and they who guard granaries need fear.
> In our myths, great men become gods to tell future generations:
> if you dare to step out, you may stand shoulder to shoulder with heaven and earth.
> In their myths, wandering spirits serve to tell the farmer:
> do not step beyond the field’s edge, or disaster will follow.”

Myth itself is the shadow of a system.
Nomads worship gods—they encourage risk.
Settlers invoke ghosts—they maintain order.







**Elder A (championing the nomadic spirit):**

> “If one only tends the fields, it is like a frog slowly boiled in warm water.
> True gods arise from long journeys, from feats that break boundaries.
> A tribe without adventure will wither and die under the fear of ghosts.”

**Elder B (championing settled order):**

> “But if everyone dreams only of distant conquests, who will till the soil?
> Without full granaries, what expeditions can be mounted?
> Innovation needs warriors, but mass production needs farmers.
> If order cannot secure sustenance, heroes will starve along the way.”

**Shaman (seeking to mediate):**

> “Perhaps what we need is a dual order:
> the nomads guard the frontiers and blaze the paths,
> the settled people guard the fields and stockpile provisions.
> Both belong to one kingdom, yet each has its own law—never to be confused.”

**Elder A:**

> “If we all dwell in the same city, bloodlines will mix,
> warriors will become farmers, and farmers will dream of becoming warriors.
> The fire of heroes will be extinguished, and the fields abandoned.”

**Elder B:**

> “Hence, separation is necessary.
> Nomads and settlers exist under the same order, yet there must be iron rules:
> no casual intermarriage, no reckless proselytizing.
> To break these laws is to betray the entire order.”

**Shaman:**

> “Separation does not mean hostility.
> Nomads bring new tools and tame new beasts;
> settlers take these skills and mass-produce them for everyday use.
> Flowing in order prevents rupture.
> Reckless mixing breeds strange peoples—both fearing ghosts and indulging in wanton slaughter—who ultimately destroy themselves.”

**Elder A (nodding):**

> “Indeed. Heroes must be born among the nomads,
> and the songs of gods must echo across the steppe and the journey.”

**Elder B (agreeing):**

> “While the shadows of ghosts and law must guard the walls and the fields.”








Qinghai Lake (Tsongon Nor) stretched vast and blue, its waters gleaming coldly under the fierce sun. To the northwest rose the snow-capped ridges of the Qilian Mountains; to the southeast lay the loess plateaus, backed by the highlands and surrounded by mountains on all sides. Kodun chose this place to summon the tribes from all directions—central, yet clearly her own domain. On the high ground by the lakeshore stood a massive wooden sculpture of a brown bear, its claws raised to the sky, symbolizing the forest and freedom, and signaling that the wilderness lay beyond imperial control. Between the ridges lay armored warriors, banners half-hidden, ready to strike any who defied her will.

Kodun sat at the high altar, wearing a crown of bear teeth, draped in white furs and a black fox cloak. She did not ask for anyone’s counsel, but spoke in the voice of a queen-mother, a herald of destiny:

---

**Words of Khatun:**

> “You are all children of the earth, dwelling where water and grass lead, living amid blood and fire. Yet if each claims kingship for himself, the tribes will fracture, the steppe will splinter.
>
> Today, upon the shores of this great Qinghai Lake, I, in the name of the Queen-Mother, declare: henceforth, this nation shall be called **Shar**, named for the sun and fire, and it shall never be changed.
>
> In the lands of Guanzhong, grain and livestock flourish. Any bankrupt herders may migrate to the wildlands with reindeer, enter the forests to hunt beasts, or remain in the Guanzhong plains to farm and herd. Life and death, choice and consequence, rest with you.
>
> The empire shall set no capital, no palace. Wherever the **Khan’s great tent** is pitched, there shall be the center of the world. The Khan bases himself in the Altai, commanding the empire’s military and civil affairs; yet the title of Khan passes neither from father to son nor brother to brother—only the truly accomplished may claim it.
>
> Military and civil officers are appointed by the edict of clouds, called ‘Cloud Masters.’ Their deputies oversee all nations, enforcing order across the lands.
>
> The brown bear is the totem of our tribe, dwelling north of Baikal. The forest is the land of freedom, the bear’s wilderness—not ours to command, nor part of human territory. Should you find the bonds unbearable, you may enter the wilderness and live alongside the bears.
>
> But any who dare claim kingship on their own, usurping the nation’s name, shall face the wrath of all armies united. Remember this.”

The tribal leaders by the lake fell silent as frost. Kodun’s words left no room for debate; they sounded like proclamations of the heavens rather than human law. Behind her stretched the highland army; before her, the lake shimmered, with no retreat in sight.

The great tent resounded with drums, bronze vessels clashing in unison, and oaths were offered with blood and wine to the lake. Thus, **the nation of Shar** was founded on the shores of Qinghai Lake, sworn by the brown bear, and all tribes were bound by its decree.









The Queen-Mother (Khatun) proclaimed the establishment of **the nation of Shar** on the shores of Qinghai Lake, installing the Altai Khan as the supreme executive officer. Once the assembly concluded, she immediately ordered the tribes to construct beacon towers at key mountain passes:

* **Altai, Tianshan, Kunlun, and Qilian Mountains**: serving as the empire’s four great barriers, each igniting the “defensive line” of the empire in sequence.
* **From east to west, from south to north**, the beacon towers responded to each other, forming an early-warning network spanning the steppes, deserts, and mountain ranges.
* The central hub was set at **Helan Mountains near Yinchuan**, the gateway to the western Yellow River and the throat between the Guanzhong Plain and the Western Regions. Once the beacon fires were lit, smoke signals could travel day and night for thousands of miles, directly reaching the Queen-Mother’s and Altai Khan’s military tents.

---

### Key Institutional Points

1. **Communication and Authority**

   * Any rebellion or external invasion could be immediately reported to the central command via beacon fires.
   * Kodun and the Khan need not reside in a fixed capital; relying on mobile armies and beacon communication, they could respond at any moment.

2. **Strategic Role of the Guanzhong Plain**

   * Serving as the grain reserve, heavily garrisoned, not only supplying the empire’s forces but also acting as the last line of defense against rebellion or foreign threat.

3. **Psychological and Symbolic Function**

   * Beacons lighting up the mountains sent a clear “warning” to all tribal leaders: although the imperial army lacked a fixed capital, it possessed unmatched rapid response capability.
   * No rebellion could go unnoticed; once the smoke rose, the empire’s forces could assemble without delay.

---

This created a **hybrid polity of nomadic mobility + agricultural reserves + mountain communication network**. It solved the rigidity and slow reaction of settled civilizations while avoiding the collapse of nomadic tribes due to lack of provisions.







### Catastrophe of the Mid-Holocene Cold Event

The long-dormant giant beneath Mount Changbai abruptly awoke without warning. The earth thundered as the volcanic crater spewed fire and thick smoke for years on end. Ashes swept across the lands, blotting out the sun; the Northern Hemisphere, already in autumn, was instantly plunged into a bitter winter.

Snow fell from the sky, mingled with volcanic ash and sulfur, forming an ominous **black snow**. The black snow blanketed pastures and farmland, withering grasses and acidifying rivers. The soil became sulfured, unable to sustain even a blade of grass. Cattle and sheep that drank the water died instantly; corpses lay in heaps, rotting and stinking across the plains.

The herds that nomads relied upon for survival collapsed overnight. Bankruptcy spread like a storm. They were forced to drive away the remaining livestock, carry the elderly and children, and head south in search of shelter. The **Guanzhong Plain**, located in a temperate river valley with abundant grain stores, became the only oasis capable of accommodating large numbers of refugees. Waves of destitute pastoralists surged in, threatening the fragile order of the plains.

Meanwhile, the disaster reached far west. The grasslands beyond the Ural Mountains also fell into desolation. Cold and black snow drove pastoralist groups from their lands. The ancestors of the **Vikings**, facing desperate circumstances, left their homes and migrated eastward. They crossed the barren plains, following grassland corridors into the **Altai Mountains** and **Hindu Kush Mountains**, seeking new refuges and pastures.

* The **Guanzhong Plain**, now swollen with refugees, became the empire’s new “population crucible,” sharply increasing pressure on food supplies and social order.
* **Altai and Hindu Kush** saw their original colonial structures disrupted by incoming groups, intensifying tensions and competition among clans.
* The **northern steppes and forests** gradually emptied, becoming the “lands of black snow,” inhabited only by bears, wolves, and wild deer—an unclaimed wilderness beyond the empire.

This cold event acted like an invisible giant hand, pushing herders, farmers, and hunter-gatherers from across the lands together, forcing them to redefine survival and social order at key nodes such as Qinghai Lake, Guanzhong, and the Altai Mountains.








In the dense forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Tungusic tribes stood for a long time at the edge of the snow. That caravan vanishing into the northern wind—reindeer, horses, humans dragging sleds—gradually shrank into a dark speck in the storm, until it completely dissolved into the horizon. They had gone, taking with them the old oaths and exchanges, taking with them the only language capable of explaining sky and earth.

The wind roared like iron, night fell too soon, and the sun seemed to have been swallowed by some immense maw. The volcanic fields of Mount Changbai erupted continuously. The mountains split like torn ribs, lava rolling forth as rivers of blood and fire, shooting from the darkness straight into the sky. The fiery glow reddened the heavens, illuminating the terrified faces of the Tungusic people.

People wailed, believing the sun had fallen into the volcano, that the firmament itself had collapsed. Only the shamans shouted madly, declaring it was not the end of the world, but the **Mystic Bird** unfurling its wings from the molten rock. In their visions, enormous black wings tore open the sky, feathers aflame, lifting the sun from its descent.

**The eagle and the lava were equated that night.**
The eagle’s piercing gaze, the fire’s scorching breath, were molded by the shamans into a new deity—the Mystic Bird (black with red, lava incarnate; a proto-phoenix reborn in fire). It became both servant and mother of the sun, perched atop the volcano, lifting the sun in its ascent and descent. Henceforth, the sun was no longer master of the sky, but a child nurtured from Changbai’s molten veins.

Fear transformed into fervor, fervor into ritual. People cast eagle feathers, ashes of fire, and sacrificial blood into the crater, praying that the Mystic Bird’s wings might restore the sun. Between the volcano’s roaring, the chants shook the earth. The tribe fell into collective ecstasy, as if each cry could coax the light to rise from the lava.

Amid the firelight and howls, the leader slowly stood. Draped in scorched eagle feathers, his forehead smeared with volcanic ash and red, he faced the people. They cried: “Yan! Yan! Yan…”

He raised his hand toward the volcanic throat:

> “The sun has returned here! The Mystic Bird guards our tribe! I am the Flame Emperor, child of the lava, master of fire!”

With this proclamation, all blame was cast upon the nomads. They had taken the old path of the sun; they had brought the omen of darkness. The Tungusic people burned their fears, forging a new myth, turning the departing nomadic culture into a symbol of enmity, directing their wrath southwest—toward the Tibetan Plateau.

They had truly become independent.
No longer reliant on foreign songs or trade, no longer seeking validation from other gods.
The volcano was the sun.
The Mystic Bird was their faith.
The Flame Emperor was the sole king.







By the shores of Qinghai Lake, the wind howled like a horn.
Tribal leaders stood shoulder to shoulder in the biting cold.
Nomads of the Altai Plateau, eyes steadfast;
Herders of the Hindu Kush, cloaked in snow;
The northern seafarers, forebears of the Vikings, golden hair draped over their shoulders—
All revered the Queen Mother, deliberating on the tides of human fate.

A decade of volcanic ash still lingered in the northern sky.
The Changbai volcanic fields erupted without cease;
Northern pastures had become sulfide wastelands,
Rivers dark as ink, winds sweeping ash and snow in relentless tides.

In the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the cold winter had long frozen the waters.
Ice bridges connected to the Guanzhong Plain.
Great herds of surviving cattle and sheep were driven onward,
Treading the frozen rivers toward the mountain-ringed basin.
Though cold, Guanzhong’s soil was less sulfide-laden.
Here, the bankrupt herders arrived,
Replicating the labor patterns of the ancient oasis civilizations,
Half-farming, half-pastoral, clinging to survival.

“The northern grasslands are dead; cattle cannot survive.
Any livestock drinking river water will be poisoned.
Valley villages lie abandoned, grain rots,
People are displaced, and the future of our children is bleak.”
—Altai Khan spoke with gravity.

“Though the Changbai flames have ceased, ash still drifts,
Rivers acidified, lakes fading in life.
Without new means of survival, our tribes will perish.”
—The chief of the Hindu Kush tribes added.

“Our boats cannot navigate the icy rivers; catches dwindle,
Game is scarce; if we do not migrate south, our families cannot endure.”
—The voices of the Viking ancestors echoed across the lake.

The Queen Mother was silent, her gaze piercing the mist over Qinghai Lake.
She knew that no one could survive the northern catastrophe alone;
Only strategy could preserve tribes and civilization.

“People of the tribes,” she spoke slowly,
“The Tibetan Plateau still holds fertile pastures; watercourses remain;
Hope for survival is not yet extinguished.
The Guanzhong Plain can shelter the bankrupt,
Let them labor the fields in rotation to maintain the foundation;
But for our core tribes,
We must breed horses hardy to the cold,
Using horses as wings, alliances as nets,
To reconstruct order and withstand the northern wind.”

The leaders bowed in silent consent; the heartbeats of all tribes merged amid the wind and snow.
From that day, cold-resistant horses were carefully bred,
Bloodlines mingled, strength and wisdom combined.
A thousand years later, they would be called Mongolian horses, galloping across the steppes.

Whispered truth:
A crisis gave rise to stratification and selective breeding.
Guanzhong became the land of labor;
The grasslands nurtured the kernel of order.
Thus, the embryo of a future empire was born.








**Night Feast by Qinghai Lake**

Deep into the night, the wind howled across Qinghai Lake. Within the Queen Mother’s tent, lamps cast a dim, amber glow, while guards stood at attention outside, spears in hand.

In the bronze brazier, charcoal blazed brightly, sending the aroma of roasting lamb leg into the air. Attendants brought two identical plates of food: **glazed roasted lamb leg**, a bowl of **milky wine**, a plate of **stir-fried eggs with chives**, and finally, a plump **red apple**.

Khatun raised her hand, signaling all others to withdraw, leaving only Altai Khan. She personally lifted one of the bronze plates, walked to his table, set it down, and took her own seat. The crisp clink of the bronze echoed in the tent, lending a solemn gravity to the moment.

She spoke softly:
**Khatun:** “Land is scarce, yet our people grow… What shall we do? The Sichuan Basin is separated from the eastern Guanzhong mountains, unable to hold more tribes. But beyond those mountains, there must be land—how much, and how far, we do not know. What are your thoughts?”

Altai Khan paused mid-cut, the bronze knife hovering over the lamb, and pondered briefly:
**Altai Khan:** “If the land is insufficient, I could lead our army south, seize the Sichuan Basin, and drive out the natives.”

Khatun shook her head, raising the bowl of milky wine and gently swirling it, the scent wafting:
**Khatun:** “The heat and humidity there, the swarms of mosquitoes, would consume our soldiers faster than any enemy. Our people endure cold, endure thin air—but the wet heat and miasma will only lead warriors to die in vain. Death by sword or spear can be mourned and honored; death by poison and fever brings no glory.”

A brief silence fell, broken only by the wind rustling past the tent’s canvas.

Altai Khan lifted his gaze, meeting her eyes steadily:
**Altai Khan:** “Then there is no need to rush south. I will assemble an expedition, venturing out to seek land. If the eastern lands are indeed vast, they will become the foundation of our future. Give me warriors and banners, and I will tread the unknown with them.”

Khatun glanced at him, slowly set down the apple, and whispered:
**Khatun:** “Go. Territory and order must always be discovered in the cracks of the earth.”








The firelight flickered inside the tent, the fat from the roasting lamb leg sizzling. Khatun cut a slice with the tip of her knife, chewed slowly, yet did not speak immediately. After a long pause, she suddenly turned to Altai Khan, her voice barely above a whisper:

**Khatun:** “Those fair-haired, blue-eyed people, crossing the grasslands in search of refuge… what shall we do? If they are left to wander freely, sooner or later they will become a liability.”

Altai Khan set down his wine bowl, fingers lightly tapping the edge of the bronze plate, and spoke gravely:
**Altai Khan:** “Khatun, if they are willing to accept our rites, sing the names of our gods, and intermarry with us, they can become allied peoples. We need not drive them out; rather, we should help them secure new land. **If outsiders can be settled, they are a bulwark, not a threat.**”

Khatun narrowed her eyes, as if gauging the edge hidden within his words.

Altai Khan continued:
**Altai Khan:** “South of the Hindu Kush lies humid, sweltering India. In the past, our warriors could only trade along the border, daunted by fever and scorching sun. Now, if this group of fair-haired, blue-eyed people dares to try, perhaps they can scout a path for us. If they truly learn to endure the wet heat, **then the Sichuan Basin will no longer remain forbidden.**”

The cold wind swept across the tent outside, lifting the flaps as if the heavens themselves were listening.

Khatun fell silent for a moment, then lifted the red apple and sliced it with her bronze knife, juice spilling over. She pushed half toward Altai Khan:
**Khatun:** “Then let them go. This half is yours, this half is mine. If they can tame the humid lands, both we and our descendants will share in the new territory.”

The bronze plate rang lightly; the half apple gleamed in the firelight, like a symbol of a new land yet to be claimed.










### Chapter II — Destruction, Absorption, Remolding

Spring winds thaw the land, snowmelt from the plateau feeding the rivers, grass tips glimmering green. **Altai Khan** stood outside his encampment on the shores of Qinghai Lake, his gaze stretching beyond distant mountains and waters, fixing upon an unknown continent far away. Spring was the season of movement and preparation—the prelude to conquest.

He ordered the reconnaissance cavalry to assemble, accompanied by **logistical units** tasked with food reserves, livestock transport, and the upkeep of tack and bows. Each detachment carried a fixed store of rations; livestock numbers were calculated with precision, ensuring that long marches would not sap strength through hunger or exhaustion.

Along the edges of the **Taihang Mountains** and the **Yanshan Mountains**, scouts spread across valleys, riverbeds, forests, and wastelands, searching for passages that could be crossed. They trod through lingering snow and ice, crossed lowlands and riverbeds, sketching invasion routes across an uncharted continent.

The extremes of climate were their trial. At night, bitter winds still swept the peaks; by day, the sun burned mercilessly. Yet for these nomads, born of pastures, such conditions forged them into an efficient war machine: **swift assembly, dispersed cover, nocturnal marches, sudden assaults.** Each rider was at once an archer, a scout, and a healer of beasts; each unit, a miniature engine of war.

Within his tent, **Altai Khan** studied maps and reconnaissance reports with care:

* The mountain passes were few—secure them first, and any defense could be divided and encircled.
* Grasslands and valleys could serve as rallying points—or as traps for ambush.
* Harsh climates were no barrier but a sieve: only the most resilient forces would endure, ensuring maximum efficiency in seizing the lands of others.

Spring sunlight fell upon tents and horses, carrying the dampness of thaw and the scent of fresh grass. Yet the calm was but a façade. Beyond, the unknown continent awaited—to be destroyed, absorbed, and remolded. The cavalry of **Altai Khan** stood ready, armed with the speed, discipline, and violence of the steppe, to draw that land into their order.









Late spring, in the valleys of the **Hindu Kush Mountains**, **Altai Khan** stood upon a high platform, overlooking the vast army assembled below. On either side of the valley, dozens of banners whipped in the wind, each representing the honor of a tribe, a clan, a lineage.

This campaign was not to be waged by nomadic cavalry alone. To lay roads and establish supply lines, **Altai Khan** summoned the **Viking tribes**—long intermarried with the Altai nomads. By now, they bore pale skin, black curls, and blue eyes, later remembered as the prototypes of the Persians and Aryans.

**Altai Khan** made them a promise:

* The lands of the oasis civilizations would belong to the **Viking tribes** as their dominion.
* The slaves, captives, and spoils of conquest would belong to the Altai nomads.

With his command, tens of thousands of horse-drawn chariots and mounted warriors surged into the valleys and onto the plateaus. Slave battalions laid temporary roads, built wooden bridges across rivers, hauled grain and weapons, sustaining the front lines. Mountain winds swept up dust; hooves shattered ice and grass, carving tracks toward the unknown.

The host advanced along the Hindu Kush toward the Iranian Plateau. The oasis cities, raised by water, were caught unprepared, their natives forced to abandon their homes. **Altai Khan** decreed: because the oasis resources were scarce, the natives could not remain. Captured warriors were marched back eastward, bound for labor and supply duties; women and children were driven to the desert’s edge, banished from fertile soil.

Chariots thundered, cavalry surged like a tide. The army pressed through valleys, crossed wastelands, steadily devouring the defenses of the oasis world. Each battle, each conquest, was but a reflection of the cycle: **destruction, absorption, remolding.** The old order was crushed beneath hooves; land and resources were redistributed; and a new order took shape, forged in blood and sweat.








Late autumn on the **Qinghai–Tibet Plateau**: morning fog hung like gauze, frost clung to the grass tips. **Khatun** sat at the center of her command tent, her gaze fixed through the flap toward the snow line outside, as she listened to the reports from the reconnaissance units returning from the eastern front in East Asia.

The scouts, moving east along the **Taihang Mountains**, reported:

* The **lower Yellow River** was no longer a surging river, but an expanse of continuous wetlands.
* Nearly a hundred tribes lived within the marshes, skilled in fishing and hunting, dwelling upon raised platforms, and building vast irrigation systems to channel waterways into their fields.
* Military activity was scarce—no signs of large standing armies.
* North of the wetlands stretched a broad plain, densely planted with millet, forming the foundation of their grain reserves.

Khatun murmured in thought:
**Khatun**: “If the chariots are to cross the Taihang Mountains, vast numbers of slaves must first lay the roads. The narrow passes are perfect for ambush; a reckless advance could cost the entire army.”

The scouts continued their report:

* On the eastern side of the **Yanshan Mountains**, they had found a natural gap, yet it led into the wetlands. Chariots could not pass directly; only by boats could troops and supplies be ferried across.
* Though the wetland tribes lacked great armies, their raised dwellings and irrigation works made the swamps themselves into a natural fortress.

Khatun lit the incense burner upon the table. Smoke curled upward as she spoke in a low, commanding voice:
**Khatun**: “Secure the mountain passes first. Only with safe roads can the army move. The wetlands may lack an army, but the terrain is perilous—we must proceed with caution. Ready the boats, to detour or to carry our supplies as needed.”

The autumn wind rustled the withered grass outside the tent, carrying with it the chill of the valleys. It reminded every nomadic rider: the conquest of unknown lands is not only a contest of strength, but also a trial of wisdom and strategy.









The following summer, **Altai Khan** returned to **Qinghai Lake** with his vast cavalry host and tens of thousands of slaves. Between the tents, horse hooves stirred up dust; flocks of sheep and stores of grain followed in orderly ranks. On the lakeshore, **Khatun** personally came forth to greet him. Together they reviewed the reconnaissance reports and the supply plans.

When the meeting concluded, Khatun withdrew once more to the Tibetan Plateau, while Altai Khan turned his gaze toward the great wetlands of the **middle Yellow River**. His decision was clear:

* Wait until the summer floods of the Yellow River had receded, then in autumn lead the army across.
* In the meantime, resettle tens of thousands of slaves along the middle Yellow River to begin constructing **inflated sheepskin rafts**. The hides, tightly bound, inflated, and fixed, would form buoyant units beneath each raft. These units could then be bound together into floating bridges, strong enough to carry chariots and cavalry in full formation.

When the autumn winds rose, the river’s waters fell, broad and placid. Dozens of **sheepskin raft bridges** now spanned the river at the Helan Mountain gap, each tended by hundreds of slaves to ensure the passage of wagons.

Upon the river, morning mist curled. The floating bridges stretched like silver serpents. From his command platform, **Altai Khan** surveyed the entire host:

* **Tens of thousands of cavalry** stood in precise formation, the war chariots aligned in columns and ranks.
* Slaves and attendants moved along both sides of the bridges, steadying the passage and maintaining the supplies.
* The wind lifted dust into the air; hooves struck the rafts with crisp echoes, like the prelude to a war drum.

At Altai Khan’s command, the first chariots rumbled onto the floating bridge. The river lapped gently against the sheepskin hulls below. One after another, chariots and riders surged forward, the entire army crossing in magnificent order into the **Guanzhong Plain**. The mingled sounds of water, hooves, and grinding axles poured forth like a flood, heralding the arrival of a highly disciplined nomadic force poised to press its order and might into the fertile wetlands.

The autumn sunlight glinted off the river’s surface and across the horses’ backs, flashing against iron armor and fluttering banners. The bridges swayed faintly, yet they bore the full weight of conquest—the resolve to **destroy the old order, absorb lands and peoples, and reshape them into a new imperial order**, soon to be unveiled on this new frontier.









Late autumn, **Altai Khan** stationed his main army in the **Lantian** region. Between the tents, horses rested, supplies were neatly organized, and soldiers and slaves busied themselves with weapon maintenance and chariot inspections. This became the forward assembly point of the Guanzhong Plain and the strategic base for the future march into the eastern plains.

Advance units were dispatched east of the **Taihang Mountains**, tasked with constructing **fortresses and watchtowers** to prevent the wetland civilization from seizing mountain passes and blocking the army’s access to the eastern plains. Stone walls and earthen embankments quickly rose, guards rotated with precision, and warriors drilled within the valleys, familiarizing themselves with the terrain and preparing for any sudden conflicts.

Altai Khan patrolled the camp, issuing orders in a low voice:
*"All the grain in the Guanzhong Plain must be harvested to provide reserves for the chariot advance. The slaves must complete the road across the Taihang Mountain gaps before next spring to ensure the entire chariot corps can enter the eastern plains unimpeded."*

The slaves acted in organized groups:

* Some harvested mature millet, wheat, and pasture crops, transporting the grain to storage depots.
* Others laid roads through the gaps in the Taihang Mountains. Valleys and narrow passes were leveled; wooden beams and stones were carefully set to ensure the chariots could pass in formation.
* Commanders established temporary outposts at mountain passes to monitor construction progress and maintain security against sudden attacks.

At night, torches lit the ridges, illuminating the progress of the roadwork. The sounds of hooves and hammering stone echoed through valleys and gorges. Altai Khan stood atop a fortress, gazing toward the wetlands of the distant plains: **everything was ready—when the spring winds arrive, the chariots will surge into the eastern plains like a flood, destroying the old order, absorbing lands and populations, and reshaping the imperial hierarchy.**

Autumn winds swept leaves along the banks of the Yellow River, carrying with them the urgency of the coming strategic operations. Though the Guanzhong Plain was already inhabited, its grain, roads, and fortifications would serve as the solid foundation for the future conquest of the eastern wetland plains.







In the spring of the following year, warm winds swept through the camp. **Altai Khan** stood on a high platform, flanked by interpreters who relayed his words to the slaves and allied tribes. Thousands of eyes were fixed upon him, a mix of anticipation and anxiety.

**Altai Khan** spoke, his voice echoing through the valleys:
*"You have endured a long winter of training and road construction. Now, the opportunity has come. Anyone willing to take up arms and join the vanguard will be rewarded for their deeds."*

The interpreters carefully explained the rules:

1. **Freedom**: Anyone who eliminates two enemies will earn their freedom, leaving behind their status as a slave.
2. **Material Rewards**: Those who defeat five or more enemies will receive livestock, grain, and basic provisions in succession.
3. **Rituals and Oaths**: Military achievements must be publicly confirmed during tribal ceremonies, overseen by **Khatun**, ensuring each warrior’s merit is remembered.
4. **Spoils and Shares**: War prizes—including captives, supplies, livestock, and land-use rights—will be distributed according to contributions. Different tribes or slave units will receive shares proportional to their deeds.

Altai Khan added:
*"Your achievements determine not only your rewards but also the honor of your tribe and slave corps. The brave may rise to lead vanguard cavalry, commanding squads and participating directly in the next stage of the advance. All rewards and shares will be publicly announced at the ritual, so that the gods and all witnesses may see your deeds."*

The interpreters relayed each sentence, and the slaves exchanged glances, gradually nodding and whispering. Some clenched their fists, others muttered prayers, while many eyes shone with anticipation—**the promise of freedom and livestock, recognition of merit through ritual and war deeds, would transform slaves into loyal warriors**.

Altai Khan surveyed the camp with eagle-like eyes:
*"Whoever wishes to join the vanguard and charge with me will decide their own fate. The brave will shape history; the timid will remain in the camp, continuing to labor for the conquests of others."*

Hundreds of slaves volunteered after the speech, joining the vanguard. Each group was led by a tribal chief, following a clear hierarchy and rules for distribution:

* Tribal chiefs distributed captives and spoils based on tribal achievements.
* Slave units received freedom or livestock rewards according to individual deeds.
* Military merit was officially recorded and confirmed by priests during the ritual to ensure fairness and symbolic honor.

The camp buzzed with a tense and exhilarating energy. Spring winds swept through the valleys, as if foretelling the chariots and vanguard units soon charging along the prepared roads into the eastern plains—**to destroy the old order, absorb resources, and reshape a new hierarchy**.







In early summer, mist clung to the foothills of the Taihang Mountains. At **Altai Khan**’s command, the massive army surged forth from camp, advancing slowly eastward. Chariots rumbled, hooves thundered, and tens of thousands of cavalry and slave units marched in orderly ranks. Flags snapped in the mountain wind, stretching like a great dragon winding through the valleys.

The vanguard bore the heaviest burden. Under the guidance of translators and military clerks, they felled forests. Trees crashed to the ground, logs were split and trimmed, and flames swept through the undergrowth, exposing wide swathes of bare earth. Thick smoke spiraled into the sky—a sign that a new order was being forcibly carved out upon the old forest.

**Fortress Construction**

* Slaves on the frontlines labored day and night, digging deep foundations.
* Massive timber poles were sharpened and driven into the ground, forming high walls in concentric layers.
* Interlaced wooden palisades were stacked inside and out, filled with heavy earth to prevent fire attacks.
* Broad flat areas were reserved in the center for command tents and military supply depots.

The fortress was designed not merely for garrisoning troops, but as a **fallback point if the army faced setbacks on the wetland plains, a place to regroup and recover**. This was Altai Khan’s signature tactic—before entering unfamiliar land, leave a wedge firmly embedded like an iron nail in the enemy’s border.

**Logistical Support**

Herders drove flocks of cattle and sheep along with the army, like mobile granaries.

* **Cattle and Sheep**: Slaughtered as needed for food, milk, and leather.
* **Dried Meat**: Soldiers carried several pounds in their packs—easy to store and convenient on the march.
* **Fermented Milk Wine**: Poured into goatskin waterbags, potent and warming—quenching thirst and warding off the chill of night.
  Soldiers often chewed dried meat while marching, washing it down with the strong, tangy wine. Only this sharp, creamy flavor could quell the unease before the battles to come.

In the valleys, axes struck timber, metal clanged on metal, and soldiers’ shouts blended with herders’ calls—a rough, martial song of the march. Under the banners, Altai Khan gazed at the peaks of the Taihang Mountains, eyes burning with fierce ambition—**beyond these ridges lay the unconquered wetland plains and fields of millet**.







In summer, the valleys were thick with humidity, and swarms of mosquitoes attacked cattle, sheep, and soldiers alike. For the nomads, the deadliest threat was not swords or spears, but this silent pestilence. **Altai Khan** ordered fires to be set around the camp; vast stretches of forest and brush ignited, flames crawling up the slopes, black smoke rising skyward. After the inferno, the vegetation lay in ashes, and the mosquitoes vanished.

Under the protection of the garrison, herders drove their cattle and sheep to the open valley for grazing, while soldiers patrolled day and night, guarding against surprise attacks by the native tribes. The air was thick with the mingled scent of scorched earth and fermented milk wine. The camp was heavy with tension. **Everyone awaited autumn**—for that was when the wetland civilization was most vulnerable.

### Autumn Assault

As autumn winds cooled and millet ripened, farmers of the wetland tribes harvested their crops, laying them across field ridges and riverbanks to dry. Then, from the hills, the sudden whinnying of warhorses erupted.

**Tens of thousands of chariot-drawn war vehicles** emerged slowly, their massive wheels crushing the earth. Banners snapped in the wind, a riot of colors rolling over the hills like waves. The once-quiet plains instantly resounded with the clash of drums and the blast of horns.

**Slave units** were pushed to the front, weapons raised as they surged into the fields, occupying drying yards and driving the fleeing wetland residents before them. Behind them, cavalry and chariots poured forward like an iron tide, harvesting millet and seizing granaries. Wherever they passed, villages burned and storehouses were emptied.

The momentum of the invasion swept across the land like autumn wind clearing fallen leaves—unstoppable.

---

### The Threat of the Wetlands

Yet as the army claimed vast tracts of land, the scene before **Altai Khan** stirred a subtle unease.

To the south stretched endless wetlands: mirrored marshes, dense reeds, and swirling mists. Hooves sank into the mud, chariot wheels barely moved. Occasionally, native dugout canoes darted through the waterways and vanished without a trace.

Altai Khan tightened his reins and stared across the shimmering waterline, a strange fear rising within him—**the advantage of cavalry was almost useless here**.

He immediately issued orders:

* The main army would hold the plains, controlling roads and farmland.
* Small detachments would patrol the boundaries, erect wooden palisades and signal towers to prevent raids by wetland residents.
* Cavalry were strictly forbidden from venturing into the wetlands.

Thus, the vast plains came under control, while the southern wetlands remained an unknown barrier.

Under the bear-banner, Altai Khan realized for the first time that conquest was not merely a straight, unimpeded charge. **Nature itself could be the most formidable enemy.**







**Second Year, Summer Flood Season**

The floods of the middle Yellow River arrived as expected, carrying the turbid silt from the mountains, surging downstream with unstoppable force. Vast waters spilled over the lowlands, and the wetlands expanded rapidly, like a gray-green maw, slowly yet inexorably devouring the once-solid boundaries.

The wooden palisades erected as a dividing line were swallowed section by section by the rushing waters, leaving only broken tops swaying amid the waves. The boundary between the plains and the wetlands was pushed seasonally northward.

Altai Khan immediately ordered the army to retreat to the fortresses on the highlands east of the Taihang Mountains. Within the camp, drums and horns sounded urgently, while soldiers hurriedly gathered supplies from the muddy grasslands. Remaining at the edge of the wetlands was too dangerous—if the natives struck amid the swollen waters, they could sever the army’s retreat through the network of streams, leaving tens of thousands trapped in mud and isolation.

Over the past six months, the land scorched by fire had slowly recovered; tender green shoots emerged, and the plains gradually became suitable for grazing and habitation. Yet the southern wetlands remained like a lurking shadow, stretching and receding with the seasons, a living adversary that could drag outsiders into the abyss at any moment.

The struggle between fire and water seemed poised to determine the course of the future.







As Altai Khan led his army to retreat to the fortresses, keeping watch over the wetlands, battle reports from the rear arrived in rapid succession. A pastoral tribe from the Greater Khingan Range had suddenly raised their banners in rebellion. They stormed the horse pastures of the Hulunbuir Grasslands, seizing tens of thousands of fine horses. This emergent force then swept toward the outer regions of the middle Yellow River, occupying key routes and attempting to trap the nomadic army permanently within the Guanzhong Plain.

They were cunning, swiftly capturing several crucial watchtowers, which prevented timely signaling of the alarm, leaving the rear garrison slow to respond. Carried by the wind, proclamations rang out loudly: **“The steppe has a new master!”**

Inside the fortress, the generals exchanged uneasy glances, discussions swelling like a tide. Some urged an immediate march to reclaim the horse pastures, while others worried that remaining trapped on the plain would gradually exhaust their forces.

After a long silence, Altai Khan issued a cold decree:
“Maintain the garrison at the fortress. Those rebels are merely infantry who have just seized horses—they know nothing of herding, nothing of driving chariots. Their display may be grand, but their foundation is shallow; there is no need for rash action.”

This was his statement to others. In truth, Altai Khan understood perfectly well: even if he led the main army to reinforce the front, they would inevitably be blocked at the Helan Mountain gap, unable to cross the river. Hastily constructing a sheepskin raft bridge would risk destruction by the enemy on the far bank; waiting for the winter freeze would not guarantee passage either, as the rebels would labor night and day to cut the ice, allowing no advance.

Retreat or hold—both were dead ends.

Under the cover of night, he quietly summoned a few trusted aides and, over the map, traced mountains and rivers, his voice low and resolute:
“I will ascend the Yellow River myself to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in search of reinforcements. If I do not return, you must hold this place at all costs—burn provisions if necessary, but never abandon the fortress.”

At this moment, fire and water, betrayal and isolation intertwined, and Altai Khan had staked his fate upon the ceaselessly flowing Yellow River.







**Autumn Winds Rise, Smoke Signals Stir**

At the onset of autumn, watchfires flared across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, like a colossal dragon of flame stretching from the southwest, crossing the Kunlun Mountains, climbing to the Tianshan and Altai ranges, and reaching as far as the Hindu Kush and the Iranian Plateau. Flames connected, smoke signals chained together.

Summoned by the beacon fires, men and women from the grassland tribes enlisted. Those over fifteen, regardless of gender, donned sheepskin, took up bows and spears, and mounted horses or chariots. Those left behind were only the elderly and infants. Across the steppe, banners snapped in the wind, tens of thousands of horses thundered forward, and blood surged with the fire—almost as if the entire land itself echoed the war song.

Following the direction of the smoke, the vast army advanced eastward, striking directly toward the Helan Mountains. In less than a month, banners had spread to the edge of the Hulunbuir Grasslands, facing across the void toward the endless, shadowed forests.

The army arrayed itself, and it seemed as though the steppe fell entirely under the iron hooves. Yet when Altai Khan and Khatun ascended the high platform and gazed north toward the dense forests and mountains, they fell into long silence.

Khatun murmured:
“That is the land of the bears. Forests and mountains are not our strength. Even if our cavalry thunders, a direct assault would cost a sea of blood.”

Altai Khan fixed his gaze on the distance, eyes reflecting the ever-present mist within the forest, and spoke in a deep voice:
“Yes. The blades of the steppe are dull here. To destroy their nests would demand the sacrifice of several tribes.”

He paused, then turned to the generals and slave legions accompanying the army:
“If blood is paid with blood, the steppe will be emptied. This war cannot be prolonged—negotiation is the only way.”

Within the flickering light of the tents, Altai Khan and Khatun discussed the terms: the division of chariots and livestock, the ownership of horse pastures, and the boundaries of rivers and forests. From this moment, the worlds of the steppe and the forest sat at the same table, attempting for the first time to determine borders through words rather than bows and arrows.








Flames leapt within the tent, mingling with the scents of strong liquor and roasted meat, yet the atmosphere was heavy and tense. Outside, tens of thousands of horses waited silently, banners snapping in the night wind. Inside the tent, only the low, deliberate conversation would decide the fate of the steppe and the forest.

**Altai Khan** pressed his hand onto the map, pointing toward the vast wetlands to the east, his voice rough and resolute:
“We need them. That wetland in the New Land—there’s no way we can conquer it ourselves. Chariots would sink into the mud, cavalry could barely advance. To truly bring it under order, we must rely on their skill with water and forests. We’ll ‘outsource’ that land to them—let the pastoral tribes expand it, rather than exhausting our own bloodlines.”

**Khatun** stared silently at the map, her gaze icy, before speaking slowly:
“Then how do you intend to make them abandon rebellion? They have already declared themselves the ‘Yan Emperor,’ claiming the steppe as their own. To bring them back under order, at least they must feel on equal footing with us.”

Her finger traced across the Hulunbuir Grasslands on the map, her tone measured:
“Give them half a horse pasture, let them regain a place to raise their herds, in exchange for loyalty. Only if they have horses will they willingly dedicate their sons to the army.”

**Altai Khan** shook his head angrily, pounding his fist on the wooden table until the wine cups trembled:
“No! They have rebelled before. If we give them pastures, their bow infantry will become mounted archers. Then they will be untamable enemies, not vassals. Half of Hulunbuir? Never!”

His gaze turned to Khatun, voice low but firm:
“They must recognize the Queen Mother as the supreme ruler. As long as they are willing to honor you as the Mother of Heaven, I will sit alongside their Yan Emperor—but the chair I take must be lower than the throne of the Queen Mother.”

Silence filled the tent, broken only by the occasional thump of the sheepskin drum in the wind.

**Khatun** suddenly let out a light, clear laugh, tinged with coldness:
“Then you must paint them an illusion more alluring than the steppe. Make them believe that wetland is an Eden, a future worth entrusting their descendants to—more than any horse pasture. Heh… since we cannot give them pastures, we will give them a dream.”

In the firelight, the two exchanged a long look. Outside, banners snapped sharply in the night wind, as if even they waited for the outcome of this political negotiation.








The autumn grass had turned yellow, and the cold wind swept across the plains.

The two armies faced each other, cavalry arrayed along the border like an iron wall. The neighing of horses mingled with the clang of armor, banners snapping sharply in the twilight. Suddenly, the archers raised their bows in unison, and arrows whistled through the air—each shaft tied with a strip of vivid red cloth, like flames set aflame. The arrow formation fell, piercing the grass in a continuous line of glaring red, dividing the land into two distinct worlds.

**Khatun** and **Altai Khan** drove their chariot slowly to the edge of the red line and stopped. Attendants unfurled thick woolen carpets with practiced ease. Nearby, iron racks held whole sheep over the fire, flames licking the hides, fat sizzling, and the aroma of roasting meat wafting through the air. The two sat side by side, sipping milk tea, calm and composed, as if waiting for old friends in a family courtyard rather than the leaders of a rival army.

On the other side, the **Yan Emperor** stood before his own lines, laughing loudly. His voice carried across the battlefield on the wind. With a wave of his hand, his archers drew their bows once more, sending another volley of red-cloth arrows into the grass, marking a new scarlet boundary—an invitation written in blood.

The Yan Emperor had no attendants. He personally placed one sheepskin water bag filled with strong liquor after another onto the captured chariots. The liquor spilled, filling the air with a fiery scent. Alone, he drove his chariot forward, stopping between the two red lines. He did not advance further nor speak a word, his silence a challenge to his opponents.

**Khatun** and **Altai Khan** exchanged a glance and shook their heads lightly. After a moment of silence, they rose almost simultaneously, choosing not to remain on the imposing chariot but to walk across the battlefield. Attendants quickly rolled up the woolen carpets, packed up the cooking equipment, and fell in step behind them.

Their steps were slow but resolute, moving toward the ground between the two scarlet lines. Authority was not in the chariot, but in every inch of earth they traversed with steady, deliberate steps.








A fierce wind swept across the grasslands, making banners snap and flutter. The Yan Emperor sat atop his chariot, a sly smile playing at his lips, and spoke first:

**Yan Emperor:** “Friends from afar, you have brought roasted sheep—I’ve brought a whole cart of fine liquor.”

With a wave of his hand, he grabbed a few sheepskin wine bags and casually tossed them onto the woolen carpet across from him. The bags hit the ground with a loud *thud*, spilling a hint of sharp, spicy aroma.

**Khatun** raised her eyes, her voice icy: “Why rebel?”

The Yan Emperor laughed heartily, lifting a wine bag to drink deeply, the liquor running down his beard. He paid no mind to decorum, replying in a coarse voice:

**Yan Emperor:** “Drink first, talk later.”

**Altai Khan** and **Khatun** exchanged a deep glance.
**Altai Khan** said coldly: “Drunk? What is there to talk about then?”

The Yan Emperor suddenly hurled the half-empty bag to the ground, the impact resounding, and shouted:
“Only when we’re drunk can we truly talk!”

He then ordered his attendants to bring more sheepskin water bags, stacking them on the woolen carpet. Bag after bag fell, piling into a small mound, the rich scent of liquor filling the air, turning the battlefield into something resembling a tavern.

A cunning smile spread across the Yan Emperor’s face as he boomed:
“If it’s not enough, I’ll have them bring more.”

Khatun and Altai Khan felt a chill run through them. Their eyes met, and their thoughts aligned:
*He intends to get us drunk, carry us back to our tents, and make any negotiation impossible.*






**Khatun** suddenly reached out and drew a small knife from her attendant’s waist. The nearby attendants froze—this should have been their task, yet she took it upon herself.

She carefully sliced off a piece of lamb, richly marbled with fat, the glistening streaks catching the firelight. Then she roasted the tail fat over the flame until it sizzled, pouring the hot oil into a copper plate.

**Khatun** placed a portion in front of **Altai Khan**, her voice low: “Start with this.”
She then cut herself a portion, letting the fat slide down her throat—heavy and rich, yet forming a protective barrier in the stomach.

Only then did the attendants bring the carefully cut pieces on a silver platter to the **Yan Emperor**.

Her expression remained stern, and she spoke not a word. Her actions were not humility—they were **a quiet defense**.
—Only by first filling their own and **Altai Khan**’s stomachs with fat could they slow the alcohol’s rush into their bloodstream.

**Altai Khan** understood immediately, silently chewing the oily meat, occasionally glancing at the mound of wine bags piled like a small hill across from them.

The **Yan Emperor** laughed heartily, lifted a wine bag, and drank deeply, shouting:
“My wine is enough to make tens of thousands of soldiers drunk! If you can outdrink me, then we can talk today!”

But **Khatun** merely wiped the fat from her lips, her gaze calm as she watched the smoke rising beside the fire. A trace of cold calculation flickered in her eyes.
She was already planning in her mind: **This negotiation will not be decided by drinking alone.**








The attendants withdrew, and the winds of the steppe rose. Banners snapped in the distance, leaving only the three of them between the red lines.

**Khatun** spoke quietly, her voice cutting the silence like a blade:
“Are there too many people, and not enough resources to go around?”

She did not ask what he wanted—because she already knew she would not give it. The question was both a prelude and a trap.

The **Yan Emperor** threw back his head and laughed: “Do you think I should admit it, or deny it?”

**Altai Khan** frowned, running a hand through his mane, his tone edged with impatience: “You didn’t just bring a cart of wine, did you? Let’s talk about something real. We’ve discovered a new land—interested?”

The Yan Emperor’s laughter halted abruptly. He sifted through the pile of wine bags, picking out a few of lower strength, and handed them over personally:
“You can’t handle it, can you? Stopped here, between the steppe and the forested mountains. The terrain there is far more complex than this forest.”

He narrowed his eyes, as if seeing through their predicament:
“My men went east, and at the far end of the wetlands found a patch of land, surrounded on all sides by water. To the west lies a great mountain—its western reaches still shallow water. To take it, one must understand how to live with water.”

**Altai Khan** and **Khatun** exchanged glances, a silent sigh passing between them. Had the attendants still been present, even a drunken Yan Emperor would not have revealed a single key detail.

Finally, **Altai Khan** asked in a deep voice: “When do we move?”

The **Yan Emperor** answered with unflinching certainty: “Next summer. When the wetlands rise, my army can first secure the lands east of the great mountain, cutting off reinforcements from the natives. As for the alliance—this winter, my eldest son will marry your eldest daughter.”

**Altai Khan** could not contain his laughter, his wine-soaked bravado and pride bursting forth: “Then my eldest son will also marry your eldest daughter!”

The three of them looked at one another, their laughter lingering in the autumn wind. Yet within that laughter was the bite of wine, the sting of political scheming, and the taste of blood and fire yet to come.







After the meal, the three spoke only a few casual words about trivial matters. Their tone was light, yet they avoided touching on the core issues. Smoke from the fire drifted slowly in the autumn wind, mingling with the scent of grease from the woolen carpets and the aroma of milk tea. The camp was quiet, solemn in its stillness.

When the meal concluded, the three parted ways. **Altai Khan** and **Khatun** walked side by side toward the tents. The grass beneath their feet had been trampled to a dark brown from the long march. Their attendants, following subtle gestures, began gathering the remaining cooking utensils and scraps of lamb.

**Khatun** spoke quietly: “From his tone, it seems the pastoral tribes intend to make their authority hereditary.”

**Altai Khan** gazed across the wind-swept steppe, a cold light flickering in his eyes: “They are a settled civilization, seemingly destined to turn power into something inheritable. Father and son… they are destined to become enemies.”

He paused, his voice dropping even lower: “Our authority, by contrast, is like a cloud—formless. One must prove by strength whether one is worthy of it. That will never change.”

The autumn wind swept across the ground, stirring the dry grass. Far off, the faint glow of signal fires seemed to foreshadow a coming storm of power. **Khatun** turned her gaze toward him and nodded slightly, understanding in her heart: this path is full of uncertainty, yet it embodies the eternal law of the nomadic order—strength rules, and authority is like a cloud.

They continued along the camp’s narrow path, their footsteps blending with the wind. Night deepened, yet their figures appeared more resolute and defined against the darkened landscape.








Inside the tent, bathed in the firelight, **Altai Khan** and **Khatun** sat at high positions. In front of them lay copper plates and sheepskin scrolls, recording the deeds of each tribe and slave legion. Surrounding them, clan leaders, strategists, herders, and soldiers held their breath in anticipation. The wind stirred the tent, flags rustled softly, and the air carried the mingled scent of heat and smoke.

**Altai Khan** cleared his throat and announced in a strong voice:
“On this campaign, military merits have been duly recorded. Today, we award those merits—each tribe and each slave legion shall receive rewards according to their achievements!”

Immediately, the clerks tallied the numbers and deeds inscribed on the copper plates: the collective merits of each tribe were recorded separately—defending forts, opening roads, protecting supplies, seizing strategic passes. **Khatun** added:
“As for the slave legions, your individual performance will determine your fate. Those who defeat two enemies shall earn their freedom; those who defeat five or more shall additionally receive cattle and sheep to sustain their lives.”

Low murmurs of astonishment and joy spread through the tent. The names written on the copper plates were read aloud one by one. Soldiers and slave warriors stepped forward from either side of the tent, bowing to **Altai Khan** and **Khatun** as they received their rewards.

A young slave legion soldier, his eyes still dusted with the battlefield’s grime, felt his heart race as his name was called—he had defeated three enemies and earned his freedom. Stepping out of the tent, he stood on the grassland for the first time as a free man. Behind him, comrades received rewards according to their deeds. A few slaves who had defeated five or more enemies were granted several cattle and sheep, their shoulders draped with woolen cloaks, eyes firm and proud.

**Altai Khan** surveyed the gathering, his voice deep and commanding:
“From this day forward, some of you have become free, while others must continue in service. Remember—true freedom comes from strength and courage. Those who earn freedom must not forget their roots; you are to safeguard the order and the tribes.”

**Khatun** added beside him:
“Remember, your achievements belong not only to yourselves, but to your tribes and to the entire nomadic order. Today’s awards recognize the brave and remind everyone—strength and loyalty are the only passports in this land.”

The wind gradually stilled in the tent, the flags hanging high. Slave warriors and soldiers marched back across the grasslands, each carrying their freedom or livestock, hearts filled with anticipation for the future. The rites had not yet begun, but the air already brimmed with the scent of victory and order.







After the ceremony of rewards, Altai Khan and Khatun ordered the construction of an altar. The wind swept up the loess along the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Outside the tent, herders and soldiers laid out wide platforms of yak hides, erected sacred pillars with wooden stakes, and adorned them with antlers, horsehair, and metal plates. In the center of the altar stood copper wine vessels and clay bowls filled with sheep’s blood and fermented milk, surrounded by blazing fires that cast their glow on every face.

Altai Khan lifted the copper vessel and spoke to the heavens:
“Heaven and earth bear witness! Today’s deeds, sealed in blood and fire! All who have struck down enemies shall earn freedom and reward; all who have guarded the tribes shall be immortalized in history!”

Khatun stood beside him, holding a long woolen banner, slowly rotating it. The wind made the banner whistle:
“Our descendants will remember today’s heroes. Their names will ride the flames and the wind, becoming legendary songs to teach future generations how to guard the nomadic way with courage, wisdom, and loyalty.”

The ritual began. Freed members of the slave legions stepped forward to the altar, hands gripping war knives—symbols of the chains they had severed. Soldiers who had defeated five enemies offered cattle and sheep. Flames licked the altar as smoke curled into the sky. Khatun softly recited ancient prayers, blessing each newly freed warrior. In the firelight, the faces of herders, soldiers, and slave legion members alike were imbued with a dignity that transcended life and death.

Altai Khan gazed over the assembly, voice deep and solemn:
“Your freedom and rewards are not gifts, but proof of your strength. Every cow and sheep, every parcel of land, every honor—you have paved the way with your sweat and blood.”

Khatun lifted a horn cup and slowly poured fermented milk onto the altar:
“Heaven and earth bear witness! The brave and the loyal are recognized today. Those who return to order will provide the source for the myths and epic songs of the nomadic army.”

The ritual continued amidst fire and smoke, the wind carrying flames skyward like a river of stars set alight across the grasslands. Inside and outside the tents, tribal members softly chanted ancient war songs, their echoes resonating across plains and valleys—a sacred acknowledgment of individual merit and collective honor in the nomadic civilization.

That night, the wind of the Yellow River and the firelight together recorded every freed warrior, every hero, every spoil, and every tale of conquest. The nomadic army had not only completed its campaign of conquest, but also consecrated order and honor, solidifying Altai Khan and Khatun’s rule while making the freedom and courage of the slave legions an eternal memory.








As the ritual concluded, Altai Khan ordered each tribe to receive their rewards according to merit. Freed members of the slave legions, shoulders draped with war knives and woolen cloaks, stepped out of the tents, their eyes glinting like a newly born sky. Each received their allotted cattle and sheep, after which they were assigned to the tribe of their choosing. The herders welcomed them warmly, integrating them into daily tribal life.

A few individuals who received cattle and sheep became truly free. They were granted small pastures or flocks to drive themselves, taking on responsibility for breeding and protection. From that moment, their lives were no longer defined by mere obedience; they had to exercise both wisdom and courage to manage wealth and sustain life.

Tribal leaders began redrawing territorial boundaries. Elders and Khatun’s emissaries calculated military merits within the tents: who had slain the most enemies at the vanguard, who had defended the borders effectively. Rewards were allocated proportionally. Every cow, every sheep, and every plot of land was recorded in the tribal ledger as a reference for the next year’s rituals and campaigns.

Altai Khan inspected the camps, reviewing the cavalry and war chariots. Herders drove cattle and sheep back onto the plains, soldiers organized their equipment, and horse-drawn chariots were repaired, polished, and painted. Flags were raised once more, marking each tribe’s honor. The newly freed members of the slave legions were assigned roles as sentinels, horse trainers, or guides, participating in the daily production and military activities of the tribes.

Khatun, at the center of the camp, discussed the newly established order with the elders:

* Each tribe must maintain posts along the borders of plains, mountains, and grasslands to prevent intrusion from outside tribes;
* Freed members of the slave legions who wish to participate in military actions must join the tribal organization and follow its command;
* Spoils of war are distributed according to military merit, ensuring individual interests are bound to tribal honor;
* Next year’s rituals and merit calculations will follow standardized procedures, creating a traceable historical record.

As night fell, fires across the Yellow River plains gradually dimmed, yet the freed warriors, herders, and soldiers softly chanted war songs and epic songs around the tents. The wind swept across the grasslands, and flags swayed gently in the night, each bearing honor, freedom, and responsibility.

In that moment, the nomadic army had not only completed its conquest and distributed rewards, but had also allowed order to take root within the tribes. Freed warriors were integrated, herders continued pasturing, soldiers maintained their war chariots, and Altai Khan and Khatun’s rule was steadily reinforced through rewards, rituals, and daily governance. This was a reconstruction of order following military action—a profound practice of power, freedom, and honor within the nomadic civilization, and the foundation for even greater campaigns to come.








In the winter of the following year, Altai Khan and Khatun sat in their tent by Qinghai Lake, the firelight casting a warm glow across their faces. Military observers from the stationed herding tribes had just returned with their report.

“Ten tribes have spent the entire winter cutting timber and building ships,” the observer reported in a low voice. “They plan to invade the lands east of Taishan via waterways in the summer.”

Khatun furrowed her brow. “Are they planning to build a city?”

The observer nodded. “Yes. A high platform has been planned along the southeastern coast of Taishan, named Ten-Day City. They killed all males over ten years old, claiming that ‘population is order,’ leaving only women and children to quickly adapt to the new rule.”

Altai Khan slowly sipped his milk wine, his gaze deep and contemplative. “This means they are attempting to establish a completely restructured order, eliminating the core forces of the old order entirely, keeping only the population capable of adapting to the new rules.”

“They also have water buffalo,” the observer continued. “They are trying to domesticate them for transport and agriculture, while clearing crocodiles from the western wetlands of Taishan, creating safe zones for the new settlement.”

Khatun spoke softly, “Their strategy is clear—population and resource restructuring, military, agriculture, and ecology integrated. But their methods are extreme. If we intervene, we must decide whether to act now or wait until their new order is established before integrating it into our system.”

Altai Khan remained silent for a long moment before speaking. “Let them proceed. The lands east of Taishan are not our priority for now. We will mainly observe, prepare, and ensure that the new order does not become a threat in reverse.”

Khatun nodded. “Record every movement. The placement of women and children, the domestication of water buffalo, the clearing of wetlands—these are all key data for integrating the new order in the future.”

Outside the tent, the cold wind howled, and the lake surface was frozen, but Altai Khan and Khatun’s eyes burned like torches. This time, they were in no hurry to conquer; instead, they incorporated the evolution of their adversary’s order into their long-term strategic calculations.








Inside the tent, the fire flickered gently, casting dancing shadows across the walls. Altai Khan and Khatun had dismissed all attendants and aides; only the two of them remained, the air tinged with faint scents of tobacco and wool.

Khatun spoke slowly, her voice deliberate: “Is it truly necessary to conquer as much territory as possible? War to sustain war is endless. Do you ever consider the exhaustion it brings?”

Altai Khan paused in thought, then replied in a low voice: “Land is finite, and usable land even more so. Even if we conquer, not all territory is worth holding. Mountains, wetlands, forests… the cost of administration is extreme, and garrisoning and logistics are enormous drains.”

Khatun nodded. “If we hand the high-cost lands to allied tribes of the same culture, they can manage them themselves, settle there long-term, maintain order, and sustain production. We only need to ensure the safety of trade caravans and allow low-cost passage.”

Altai Khan smiled. “War should not be about infinite expansion, but about systemic operation. Conquest is not measured in quantity, but in maximizing efficiency. Each parcel of land must yield its value while avoiding overextension of human resources.”

Khatun added, “Allied tribes can handle defense, maintain trade, transport, and cultural exchange. We only need to control key nodes and strategic points, holding the core of the network; the rest can flow freely.”

Altai Khan nodded. “It is like an order in the clouds—stable at the core, fluid at the periphery. The purpose of war is not to devour, but to maintain the long-term operation of the entire system.”

They exchanged a glance. The silence inside the tent was softly filled by the fire’s warmth. Outside, the cold wind howled, but within, the air was heavy with their meticulous thoughts, like a calm lake surface hiding a restless undercurrent.







Time passed swiftly, a hundred years slipping by like an arrow, and over that century, the empire’s territory gradually expanded under strict order and institutional control. The pastoral tribal confederations used domesticated water buffalo as transport beasts, occupying the vast wetlands of the lower Yellow River. The water buffalo became not only powerful tools for transportation but also indispensable laborers for reclamation and cultivation.

The wetlands of the lower Yellow River were divided and managed by the pastoral tribal confederations. Each tribe took turns sending slaves to reinforce dikes and manage the waterways. What had once been uncontrollable silt and flooding was now a regulated resource. Annual, cyclical breaches were systematized—slaves were required to follow precise plans to carve newly formed wetlands into river channels, and convert parts of the land into arable fields. Sediment deposition, riverbed elevation, and flood overflows were all incorporated into a long-term labor cycle and governance system.

Over the course of a hundred years, ten pastoral tribal confederations endured countless wars of annexation and alliances, eventually merging into a vast tribal conglomerate with a unified command and resource allocation system. Utilizing the labor of the indigenous slaves, they transformed the southern wetlands of the lower Yellow River into arable land, establishing a stable agricultural production zone. The northern lands of the lower Yellow River remained under the control of the nomadic tribes, preserving pastures, horses, and military stock.

Thus, the empire’s territory expanded north of the Huai River. South of the Huai, excessive humidity allowed the indigenous population to adapt, but nomadic and pastoral tribes could not maintain long-term settlements, creating a natural barrier beyond which the empire did not advance.

Throughout this century-long cycle, the Yellow River was more than a boundary—it was a laboratory for imperial governance. Year after year, sediment settled, floods breached dikes, lands were reclaimed, and rivers were channeled, forming a systematized ecological labor cycle. Slaves, laborers, and tribal warriors moved between rivers and wetlands, their labor not only sustaining the empire’s food supply but also shaping the grand patterns of human interaction with nature.









*Another hundred years passed. The prairie fires flickered once more, and new conversations unfolded beneath the night sky.*

**Khatun:**
“How do we truly define the strong and the weak? Are the descendants of the strong destined to remain strong?”

**Elder Shaman:**
“On the steppe, strength and weakness are determined solely by will, never by bloodline. The battlefield does not distinguish between men and women, nor does it care if muscles are massive. In our wrestling—Bökh—only results matter. Even the largest man can be thrown to the ground in an instant by a seemingly delicate woman. Remember: when someone endlessly boasts of their ancestors’ glory, they have already proven that they possess no strength of their own—they are weak.”

**Khatun:**
“That means among our descendants, some will inevitably lack resolve, fearing risk. How should we select or expel such offspring? If we do not screen them, what will happen?”

**Elder Shaman:**
“If a civilization only reproduces endlessly without a mechanism of renewal, it is like a cow that eats grass without ever excreting. It will grow bloated, rot, and eventually suffocate. Animals must excrete; civilizations must metabolize as well. Renewal is not cruelty—it is the law of survival. If those who fear risk are not driven out, their weakness will spread like a plague, until the entire tribe forgets how to ride freely across the steppe.”







### **“Eden Project” Qinghai Lake Assembly**

Night draped the sky, and Qinghai Lake mirrored the stars like a black glass. The scent of bonfires, cattle, sheep, and warhorses mingled with the cold lake air. The feast’s fire roared above head height, and the aroma of meat in bronze cauldrons drifted with the wind. The newly appointed **Khatun**, as the Mother Queen, sat upon the high platform, adorned with waterfowl feathers and a bronze belt. She summoned representatives from the Altai nomadic tribes to the north, the Tungusic pastoral groups to the east, and the distant Viking-Aryan branch from the west.

**Khatun** (rising, raising her cup, her voice like thunder yet softened by maternal warmth):
“Brave warriors, scions of all tribes, today at Qinghai Lake, we gather not merely to honor a century of conquest, but to forge a new paradise—**Eden**.

The wetlands stretching southeast of Mount Tai are where we shall build cities and establish our works. This will not be a steppe for warhorses to gallop across, but an eternal city of stone and timber. Safe, fertile, self-sustaining—like a mother’s embrace, it will shelter all descendants filtered by the plains. There will be rich fields, never-ending grain, and sanctuaries for generations to flourish.”

(She paused, scanning the assembly with a sharp gaze.)

“Yet understand this: **Eden is not designed for the strong.**
The steppe belongs to the adventurers, to those daring enough to chase new horizons. The pastoral tribes will serve as the intermediary bridge, governing this wetland civilization. They will guard, tame, and guide it in our stead.

From now on, the steppe will burn eternally beneath the sky—a flame of innovation, risk, and upheaval.
Eden, however, will be the place of excretion. Those sent to Eden shall never return to the steppe. Let them build, cultivate, and propagate there, forging a new face of civilization.”

(She slowly raised her hand, signaling the musicians to stop, the firelight casting shadows across her face.)

“We will grant them a new narrative—agriculture will be celebrated as the core of human civilization; the flame of the steppe will remain hidden, preserved only in our blood and will.

Thus, the brave and the weak each find their place, adventure and comfort each follow their path. The steppe shall never be burdened, and Eden shall become the abyss for our selection and renewal. There, descendants will grow complacent, entangle themselves, and be tamed by order.

And we shall forever ride toward new horizons!”

---

At that moment, the tent fell silent. The Tungusic shaman bowed his head in quiet. The Viking chieftain raised his horn in a roaring drink. Altai warriors exchanged glances, their eyes burning with a mixture of fear and excitement.

The bonfires crackled, as if witnessing an unprecedented divergence of civilizations.
