**The Battle of Fractures**
*Preface*

* **Jochi = Kingmaker of Kings**
* **Genghis Khan = King of Kings**
* 1227 = Dual collapse of the empire’s core
* Börte and Tolui face a power vacuum
* Jochi’s three sons are not yet chosen → the Kurultai cannot convene
* The empire enters a “systemic vacuum”

In 1227, the Mongol Empire plunged abruptly into an abyss. The burden on Temüjin’s heart was already heavy, but fate proved even harsher: his eldest son, Jochi, the first Kingmaker of Kings, suddenly died in the Golden Horde. When the news reached all corners of Mongolia, Temüjin himself had already passed away at Xingqing Prefecture in the Daxia—within the same year, the King of Kings and the Kingmaker of Kings fell in succession. For the empire, this was an unprecedented political earthquake.

As Khatun, Börte was filled with fear and uncertainty. Losing the support of her eldest son meant that her youngest son, Tolui, became the sole hope. Yet under the laws of the steppe, she had no authority to interfere in the succession of the Golden Horde’s khanship. She was left with a difficult choice: appoint her young son Tolui as regent, while waiting for Jochi’s sons—Orda, Berke, and Batu—to decide who would become the new Kingmaker of Kings of the Golden Horde.

From 1227 to 1229, the Mongol Empire resembled a colossal beast without a heart: without the support of the Kingmaker of Kings, the throne of the King of Kings remained unoccupied, and the Kurultai could not convene. The empire entered a period of blankness; the inertia of power was completely broken. Anxiety spread among the people, and the loyalty and order of the Mongol pastoralists wavered. Börte and Tolui could only carefully maintain a fragile surface stability amid the crisis.

Ultimately, the succession dispute in the Golden Horde dragged on until 1235, when Batu, through perseverance and strategy, prevailed—finally securing the position of Kingmaker of Kings and restoring a measure of order to the Mongol Empire. But the lesson was profound: the life or death of an empire often hinges on the gaps in institutional design and the transfer of power.

For this reason, the United States goes to great lengths in institutional design to avoid overlapping congressional and presidential elections. Even if a president dies or resigns, the remaining term must be completed according to the line of succession, to prevent a power vacuum from leading to national “collapse.” The history of the Mongol Empire reminds the world: even the smallest fissures in institutions and succession can determine the survival or demise of a civilization.



Europe has long attempted to portray the Mongol Empire as a highly centralized state, as if only a supreme central authority could explain its immense power. In reality, the opposite is true: the terrifying military capability of the Mongols stemmed from a highly evolved military-political complex. By contrast, although the Song dynasty enjoyed commercial prosperity, its military-political complex had long been filtered down to just craftsmen and merchants; the military system had been eliminated. This did not make the Song indifferent to the Mongols—it made them unable to fully comprehend the efficiency and evolutionary logic of the Mongol military-political complex.

At its core, the Mongol Empire was an experiment in pushing the limits of abandoning bloodline-based rule. Its territory at one point surpassed that of the Tang dynasty, and the military-political complex experiment was a success: cultural sovereignty and military power were separated for the first time, yet remained highly coordinated. Even when most of Eurasia fell under Mongol control, Temüjin did not invade the Song border, demonstrating the strategic discipline and institutionalization of the Mongol Empire.

However, in 1227, the deaths of both the Kingmaker of Kings and the King of Kings in the same year dealt a severe blow to this political experiment. By 1229, Ögedei, in alliance with Chagatai, forced Börte’s son Tolui to relinquish his regency and claimed the title of King of Kings for himself. The following year, Börte passed away, and internal disorder in the Mongol Empire was left unchecked. Although Tolui’s military achievements far surpassed Ögedei’s and he inherited most of Temüjin’s forces, he could not directly prevent the restructuring of power.

In 1232, Ögedei orchestrated a campaign in which Tolui and he jointly attacked the remnants of the Jin dynasty, defeating 150,000 Jin cavalry with 40,000 Mongol horsemen, thus cementing Ögedei’s military reputation. On the return journey, Tolui was poisoned, and his forces and authority were transferred to Ögedei’s son, Kurey. This blatantly violated the laws of the steppe, yet it also revealed that the symbiotic relationship between the Golden Horde and the King of Kings had broken down: the party controlling the strongest military force no longer cared about proxies or the distribution of imperial interests.

Between 1235 and 1242, the Golden Horde invaded Europe, and military merit became the practical criterion for succession to the Kingmaker of Kings, rather than formal institutional rules. After Ögedei’s death in 1241, his wife Töregene took charge of governance until 1246, ensuring that their son Güyük ascended as King of Kings. From beginning to end, these events violated the steppe laws: the elevation of the King of Kings occurred without the consent of the Kingmaker of Kings, but the Golden Horde realized the transfer of power through military accomplishments, control of armed forces, and political reality.




### **The Black Wind of 1248: Qüyü’s Decision and the Echoes of the Mongol Empire**

In the early spring of 1248, the sky over Khara-Khorin was gray like a sheet of pressed iron.
Qüyü sat inside the Great Khan’s tent, fingertips tapping lightly on the edge of the map. He knew the throne of the King of Kings he occupied was bright—but as thin as ice. True power did not reside here; it lay further west, at the edge of the steppe, in the colossal force controlled by the descendants of Jochi.

**The Golden Horde—the nest of the Shatuo military-industrial complex.**
This was neither a “vassal state” nor a “border power.” It was the heart of the other half of the empire, the position Temüjin had deliberately created for his eldest son: the Kingmaker of Kings. Qüyü knew clearly that as long as that half existed, he would forever be a proxy—allowed to sit in the seat, but never truly owning it.

So he made a decision that could almost be called “suicidal.”

**Westward—eradicate the Golden Horde, uproot the Shatuo system.**
Qüyü understood that once he destroyed them, he would no longer have to abide by the laws of the steppe, no longer watch Batu’s face, no longer serve as King of Kings under the shadow of the Shatuo military-industrial complex. He needed a reckoning, a complete rupture.

One hundred thousand troops were assembled—silent, dry, like blood hardened by the wind.
This was the first truly ruthless declaration he made to the entire Mongol Empire.

---

### **Whispers of Sorüteni**

Tolui had long been dead, yet his shadow still roamed the night of the Mongol Empire.
Tolui’s widow, Sorüteni, understood that Qüyü’s expedition was no ordinary campaign—it was a declaration of war against the entire Shatuo system, against the entire law of the steppe.

She swallowed her hesitation and sent the wind westward—to Batu.

No drums, no horns—only a secret messenger cutting across the steppe.

When Batu received the news, he was leaning in a pine chair by the Volga River. In that instant, there was no surprise in his eyes, only a cold certainty:
**“It has come. It has finally come.”**

For Qüyü’s blade was bound to fall sooner or later.

---

### **The Iron Flow in the West and Hesitation in the East**

Batu did not wait for the winter snows to melt. He mobilized one hundred thousand troops, augmented by the knights of the Moscow principality.
He understood—if Qüyü reached the outskirts of the Golden Horde, the Jochi line would be wiped out in an instant; the Shatuo military-political system would be dismantled to its very bones.

Yet on the other side of the steppe, Qüyü’s hundred-thousand-strong army, though imposing, carried a strange anxiety.

They had no certainty of victory.
No confidence to face the Shatuo system head-on.
All they could rely on was “surprise” and Qüyü’s determination.

Thus, the army advanced westward with the mentality of gamblers.

---

### **The Arrival of Death**

But Qüyü never reached the battlefield.

Halfway, he died.
Cause unknown.
The most common explanation on the steppe was:

**“The moment he decided, he was already dead.”**

As if some immense structure would not allow him to cross its boundary.

At the instant the army heard the news, it was as if its backbone had been pulled out—they quickly disintegrated.
No one was willing to continue westward to die for Qüyü.
They had always been mere pieces in a hastily arranged, hysterical war.

Batu’s forces reached the border steadily, only to find the battle unnecessary.
The enemy had already scattered on its own.

---

### **The Echoes of the Empire**

The news of Qüyü’s death reached Khara-Khorin, and the Mongol tribes withdrew like tides—
No one wanted to bear the consequences for a Great Khan who was already dead, and no one dared provoke the Shatuo system.

At that moment, the Mongol Empire revealed a truth it had never fully acknowledged:

**Whoever controls the military-political complex is the true master of the empire.**

Qüyü’s death was sudden, yet inevitable.
He had challenged the other half of the empire, and that half was not a collection of tribes—it was a structure, an older, colder, more resolute power than he could confront.




## **The Takeover of the Golden Horde (1250–1260)**

Qüyü’s death made the steppe winds suddenly lighter, yet also suddenly colder.
The war that had not truly begun was over—but it revealed a deeper and more dangerous fact:

**The Golden Horde was ready to no longer tolerate a disobedient proxy.**

---

### **1250: Möngke’s Westward Journey**

In the winter of 1250, Tolui’s son—Möngke—left Khara-Khorin on a snowy night.
This was no ceremonial visit; it was a knock on the door carried with fear and a gamble.

He went to see Batu—to see the “Kingmaker of Kings.”
More precisely, he was going to meet the true stakeholder behind the Shatuo military-political complex.

Möngke’s core request was simple:

**“Permit us to attack the Song Empire.”**

To outsiders, this seemed like a mere military plan.
But within the Mongol Empire, it was a highly dangerous template integration:

* The Shatuo military-political complex had a template in the west (steppe warfare → logistics → deep penetration → colonization).
* Behind the Song imperial house lay another ultimate template (advanced logistics → technical craftsmen → urban warfare structures).

**What would happen if the two templates merged?**
Möngke did not know.
But the Golden Horde did.
And that was precisely what made them hesitate, scrutinize, and even fear.

---

### **1251: The Golden Horde Cavalry Enters Khara-Khorin**

In the spring of 1251, Berke, dispatched by Batu, led 100,000 cavalry into Khara-Khorin.

That day, dust swirled beneath the city walls like a warning forged from steel and storm.

**The Golden Horde officially began intervening in the succession of Mongol Empire proxies.**

Möngke was enthroned as the new “King of Kings.”
But everyone understood:

* He was not a sovereign, but the **first CEO**;
* The Golden Horde was the **chairman + majority shareholder (70%)**;
* The Mongol Empire had been re-integrated as the “front-end execution layer” of the Shatuo system.

Then came the purge.

A midnight storm uprooting the old order:

* Qüyü’s wife, Haymis, executed.
* Hucha and Naohu exiled to Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.
* Ögedei’s grandson, Shirimen, killed.
* Chagatai’s direct line—Sut Möngke and Buri—also executed.

**The laws of the steppe were replaced by the Golden Horde.**
The old order of the Golden family was completely deleted by the Shatuo military-industrial complex.

At that moment, the Mongol Empire became, for the first time, a **truly joint-stock empire**.

---

### **But one question went unasked:**

**“After conquering the Song Empire, what will the two templates merge into?”**

The Golden Horde had not thought this through—
Or perhaps they had, but refused to admit it:

> This would be a technical explosion capable of overturning the entire Golden family.

---

### **1259: Death Before Diaoyu Fortress**

Möngke died in the mist and rain of the Sichuan basin, at the edge of the Song Empire’s military template, at the moment when the two templates were about to merge.

His death was like an axe, cleaving the entire strategic situation into fragments.

For the Jochi family, it was the first realization:

**The Shatuo military-political complex was devouring the Golden family.**

Not a conspiracy, but evolution.
Not murder, but elimination.

---

### **Berke’s Roar: The Awakening of the Golden Family**

When the news reached the Golden Horde, Berke remained silent for a long time.
That silence was like the spine of a knife in the night.

Finally, he roared:

**“You deceived us?”**

The answer came from the master of the Mo school, the silent observer who had always stood behind cultural sovereignty.

He replied calmly:

**“No, we have spoken only the truth.
But we answer only the questions you ask.
You never asked:
‘Under cultural sovereignty, do we still need bloodlines?’”**

Berke was stunned.

The voice of the Mo master seemed to come from the depths of a millennia-old system:

**“Under cultural sovereignty, there is no bloodline.
And there is no concept of Genghis Khan’s descendants.
You are only the initial carrier, not the final form.”**

In that moment, the Golden Horde realized for the first time:

**They were cooperating with a structure that existed purely for evolution—beyond blood, beyond loyalty.
And this structure had already begun to consider eliminating them.**




## 🔥 **1260–1269: The Collapse of Steppe Order and the Shatuo–Golden Horde System Enters the “Anti-Kublai Alliance Era”**

**The Mongol Empire did not collapse because of external enemies, but because the Great Khan sought to destroy the military-industrial complex (the Shatuo–Golden Horde system) and discovered he had no authority to do so.**

---

### **① 1260: Ariq Boke Ascends, the Great Khan’s Power Becomes a Hollow Shell**

Ariq Boke represented:

* Steppe traditional succession law (Khuriltai)
* The steppe tribal cavalry system (already in decline)
* The old political center of Khara-Khorin (lacking an economic base)

Kublai represented:

* Agrarian finance (Central Plains)
* Han military-industrial and supply chains (Northern Han forces becoming primary)
* Coalition diplomacy with the other khanates (supported by Hulegu)

**Ariq Boke represented the old steppe era; from day one, Kublai was no longer a product of the Mongol system.**

---

### **② Kublai’s Greatest Crisis: His Rebellion “Scared the Mongols Away”**

**Once Kublai rebelled, the Mongol herders fled immediately because they knew he was establishing a “non-steppe order.”**

More fatally:
**Mongol forces on the Southern Song front (already heavily Han and Khitan) defected to the Song army.**

This is a historical fact seldom told: what Kublai was really doing was the largest-scale **military-political system transition in Mongol war history.**

He had no choice but to replace 60% of his army with Northern Han troops. This was not “preference”—it was **necessity.**

From that moment on:

**Mongol Empire = dead
Yuan Dynasty = a state ruled by Mongol blood but essentially a Han military-industrial system.**

---

### **③ 1262–1264: Golden Horde vs Ilkhanate (essentially a struggle over who controlled the Shatuo military-industrial system)**

* Golden Horde (closest to the Shatuo military system)
* Ilkhanate (Hulegu relied entirely on Persian finance and Near Eastern military industry)

Victories south of the Caucasus proved one thing: **the Golden Horde’s production system was more hardcore than the Iranian military-industrial system.**

Meanwhile, Kublai struggled in the east because:

* His army was a multi-ethnic mixed force
* Supply chains were overextended
* The Central Plains’ finances were not fully under his control

Yet in 1264 he captured Khara-Khorin and eliminated Ariq Boke: **this was not a Mongol Empire victory—it was the empire’s funeral.**

Kublai declared independence, abolished the steppe law, and renamed the state **“Great Yuan, Great Mongol State.”**

This also directly marked: **Genghis Khan’s grandchildren had ended the Mongol Empire.**

---

### **④ 1266–1269: The Golden Horde Becomes Leader of the “Anti-Yuan Alliance”**

Here is a crucial point:

**In 1266, after Berke died, Mengu-Timur succeeded him.
He was not a successor to the Mongol Empire, but a successor to the “Shatuo–Golden Horde military-industrial empire.”**

So when Kublai ordered the Golden Horde to send troops to assist in attacking Kaidu…
**it became, of course, a century’s joke.**

In this logic, Kublai was:

> a man who rose through the Central Plains’ military-industrial system,
> yet believed he could command the steppe’s military-political complex.

It was like a CEO leaving a company to start a new business, but thinking he could still deploy the old company’s R&D department.

---

### **⑤ 1269: The Treaty of Talas—The Historical Endgame**

This treaty essentially established one fact: **the Mongol Empire was not “split,” it was deconstructed by the Golden Horde.**

The Ilkhanate, Chagatai Khanate, and Ögedei Khanate all became “independent states under the Golden Horde’s security umbrella.”

In other words:

> **Kublai built a state;
> the Golden Horde built a system.**

States die; systems endure.

---

### **Summary**

* Qüyü tried to destroy the Shatuo military-industrial system → he was doomed
* Ariq Boke was the last struggle of steppe institutions
* Kublai abandoned steppe law completely → the Mongol Empire died
* The Golden Horde inherited the military-industrial system → became the Eurasian system’s dominant power
* Ilkhanate, Chagatai, and Ögedei Khanates redefined themselves under the Golden system
* After 1269, the Mongol Empire was no longer a state, but a network of military-industrial–fiscal complexes







### Stage Play: **“You Should Leave Now, and Never Come Back”**

**Time:** 1294
**Location:** In the truce-negotiation tent at the boundary between the two armies outside Karakorum, the former capital of the Mongol Empire
**Event:** Peace negotiations between the Great Yuan / Great Mongol State and the “Anti–Great Yuan Great Mongol State Alliance”

**Delegates of the Great Yuan / Great Mongol State:**

* Kublai Khan (78 years old)
* Prince of Beiping, Namqan, Kublai’s fourth son (held as a hostage by the Golden Horde from 1277 to 1285)

**Delegates of the Anti–Great Yuan Great Mongol State Alliance:**

* Tsar Toqta of the Golden Horde
* Representative of the Military-Industrial Complex: the Grand Master of the Mohist School
* Kaidu, Khan of the Ögedeid Khanate
* Duwa, Khan of the Chagatai Khanate




## **Act I**

**[Stage]**
Outside Karakorum, a frozen steppe.
The boundary between the two opposing armies is marked by a silent white line.
Cold wind lashes the great tent, making the felt walls snap and ripple.

Inside, a dim butter lamp flickers.
Kublai Khan sits on a cushion, leaning on his cane—like an ancient stone stele about to collapse.

---

### **Kublai (hoarse, but still burning with anger)**

For the sake of evolution…
Are you not afraid
that even the Golden Family could be eliminated?

(He lifts his head; his eyes are clouded, but a stubborn spark still fights to survive.)

---

### **Toqta (a cold, contemptuous laugh)**

You’re afraid?
You only learn fear at *your age*?

(He steps toward Namqan, staring at him the way one examines a frail young horse.)

When this child of yours was a hostage in Kiev…
Did he ever see a single one of my men
fear being eliminated?

Your father wasn’t “evolving.”
He was—

**securing for you descendants a cheap, safe, competition-free hereditary throne.**





Namukhan tried to speak, but Kublai raised a hand to stop him.

---

### **Kublai (hoarse, nearly gasping)**

Moists…
I ask you—

(He fixes his gaze on the Moist Grandmaster, as if staring at an old god without a soul.)

Did you not, long ago, promise my grandfather, Temüjin,
to help him build…
**an empire without bloodlines, without hereditary succession, governed solely by cultural sovereignty?**

I remember you saying it.
You said it would be a new order for humankind.

---

### **Moist Grandmaster (voice calm to the point of coldness)**

Genghis Khan demanded “order.”
What we gave him was a “formula.”

As for your Golden Family…
Whether you could keep pace with the formula
was never part of the plan.

(He pauses, as if stating a law of nature.)

You are being eliminated.
It is not betrayal.
It is—
**a natural consequence.**

---

Kublai felt as if a knife had pierced his chest; his shoulder trembled.




### **Kaidu (indifferent, like an old wolf who has seen it all)**

Kublai, you think too much.
You were not forced into rebellion by us;
you forced yourself into it.

You wanted Han bureaucracy, Song taxation, Persian astronomy, and the steppe army…
One man, greedy to this extent,
is bound to be rejected by all systems at once.

---

### **Duwa (wearily mocking)**

We’re only telling you in advance—
**you are no longer part of the Steppe.**

---

### **Kublai (suddenly erupting, voice trembling but forceful)**

Then what do you want me to do?
Do you want the Yuan to be like you—
endlessly fighting within, endlessly purging, endlessly pushing the Golden Family toward the cliff?

All I wanted was to preserve a bit of bloodline.
A bit of position.
A bit of continuity.

Is that… so unreasonable?!

---

### **Moist Grandmaster (emotionless)**

You’ve misunderstood the question.

**We do not oppose continuity.**
What we oppose is—
you using continuity as a justification for power.

Power belongs only to the nodes that can maintain the speed of evolution,
not to a surname.

---

Kublai felt as if all his strength had been drained, collapsing back onto the cushion.

He looked at the four of them, his eyes asking silently:
*"What have I been holding on to all these years?"*

The four remained silent.
They would not answer.
Because they knew—
Kublai was no longer entitled to hear the answer.




### **Act II**

Kublai spoke in a hoarse, choking whisper:
*"If evolution can even eliminate itself, then what use is this evolution to me?"*

The Moist Grandmaster was about to respond when Toqta cut in:
*"What we want is this: even if our descendants are no longer kings or nobles, even if they are commoners, they can freely do what they wish. You know us well—you know we cannot afford to take unnecessary risks. To be an emperor? Where does the Mongol Empire leave an emperor? When Genghis Khan was alive, he had already divided half the empire to establish the Golden Horde. Are you not afraid your descendants, if they fail in competition, will live worse than a dog? Under cultural sovereignty, taking risks is the only way to achieve greatness. And if you change the emperor, if your generals succeed in a coup, what happens to your descendants? If the slaves rebel successfully, what then?"*

Kublai froze, as if Toqta had struck a nerve he had long pretended did not exist.

**Kublai (softly):**
*"…But isn’t the empire itself built to prevent us from being eliminated?"*

Toqta smiled bitterly, a smile tinged with the Steppe’s unique clarity and fatalism.

**Toqta:**
*"Empire? Khans? These are all conveniences. You don’t really think Genghis Khan conquered the world so his great-grandsons could hold a fixed palace position called 'emperor,' do you?
We Mongols have no illusions of 'dynastic perpetuity.' We only believe—**opportunity is always outside, never on the throne.**"*

Only then did the Moist Grandmaster speak, his voice calm yet carrying the weight of judgment:

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"Institutions are not guarantees—they are gambling tables.
Your choice is this:
—Do you want a civilization that can replicate, evolve, and expand?
—Or do you want a fixed, frozen order centered around yourself?
These two will always be in conflict."*





Kublai’s brow tightened, like a beast cornered against a wall.

**Kublai:**
*"But I… I just want a place where my descendants can have shelter from the storm."*

This time Toqta almost shouted:

**Toqta:**
*"Shelter from the storm? That’s the mindset of farmers!
A child of the Steppe, give him a horse and a bow, and he will carve out his own sky!
If you build a vast empire to trap them, you are cutting off their legs!"*

He paused, staring Kublai down:

**Toqta (pressing):**
*"Do you dare guarantee that your descendants will hold the throne for generations?
Do you dare guarantee they won’t be slaughtered worse than dogs in some coup?
Do you dare guarantee that a thousand years from now, Mongols will still recognize your bloodline?"*

Kublai fell silent.

The Moist Grandmaster slowly stepped closer, his tone offering a final choice:

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"Evolution is not meant to give you comfort; it is meant so that your descendants, **even if they lose everything, will still have a future.**
The empire’s mission is not to protect your status,
but to ensure—
**your cultural modules can restart anywhere in the world.**
As long as civilization can be backed up, your descendants will never truly die."*

Kublai lifted his head, eyes pained and hesitant:

**Kublai:**
*"But… if evolution can discard even me, then what… what am I?"*

Toqta slowly crouched down to meet his gaze—an honesty shared only between Steppe brothers:

**Toqta:**
*"What are you?
You are—
**a node of this civilization.**
Not the main server."*

The air instantly turned as cold as a northern winter night.

**Toqta (softly):**
*"The power of the Mongols has never been a Khan alone; it is this entire way of life that can spread across the world.
If you try to sit on an eternal throne, what will ultimately be destroyed is not yourself—
but the very ‘replicability’ of this civilization."*




## **Act Three**

Kublai felt as if someone had shoved him violently from behind; he stumbled forward a step, his throat trembling:

**Kublai (almost shouting):**
*"The Song Empire! The Song Empire! Their emperor isn’t eliminated—why can’t we be the same?!"*

For a moment, Toqta’s expression softened with a pity that said, *“You really still don’t understand.”*

**Toqta:**
*"The youngest son of the Torei clan—you think we’re fools?
The Song state an empire? The Song state doesn’t even have an *emperor*."*

Kublai froze: *“…What?”*

Toqta stepped forward, lowering his voice, as if revealing a truth everyone knew except Kublai:

**Toqta:**
*"That so-called emperor of the Song—you ever seen him issue an edict?
They don’t have edicts at all.
Without the signatures of the Secretariat, Chancellery, and Privy Council, he can’t even repair his own house."*

The Moist Grandmaster quietly added, his tone as calm as a weather report, yet each sentence pierced illusions like a blade:

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"The emperor of the Song isn’t ‘not eliminated’—
*he has never been on the decision-making chain.*
What gets eliminated isn’t the person—it’s the position.
They eliminate power itself, not the one sitting in that chair."*

Kublai froze completely.

For the first time, he realized:

**The Song did not preserve the emperor—the Song abolished the ‘emperor’ as a position.**






## **Act Four**

Kublai slammed his hand on the table, his voice hoarse:
*"And you still approved Möngke’s campaign against the Song Empire?! You knew full well we would die like that!"*

The Moist Grandmaster looked at him without flinching, his face carrying a calm certainty, as if saying, *“This is something you must understand.”*

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"They no longer answer to us, Kublai.
The Song civilization has evolved into a *logistics-driven civilization*.
A massive machine that runs on waterways, artisan communities, and large-scale, meticulous division of labor."*

He paused, letting Kublai feel the harsh reality that *the world had changed*.

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"In this civilization, the navy is highly developed, and supply lines move ten times faster than your steppe logistics.
Don’t play dumb.
Didn’t you attack by trying to avoid their coastline?
Nibbling your way in from the Sichuan Basin?
How many of your people died? A hundred thousand? Two hundred thousand? Or a million?"*

Kublai gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with pain, shame, and a sense of utter abandonment.

**Kublai:**
*"You’re mocking us!"*





The Moist Grandmaster shook his head, showing for the first time a genuine helplessness.

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"No.
For all adventurers, our principle has always been—
**never to point out the risk.**
We don’t want to dampen the spirit of those willing to take chances."*

Kublai’s eyes widened.
*"A principle?! This is using a knife through someone else’s hand!"*

But the Moist Grandmaster completely ignored his anger, continuing in that calm explanatory tone, as if reading a verdict on behalf of history itself.

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"It’s just… very clearly, you never listened carefully when the Song officials explained their system.
You twisted everything your way.
You wouldn’t listen.
You only hear what you want to hear."*

Kublai looked as if struck by a whip, his face collapsing.

The Moist Grandmaster continued, his voice now tinged with a hint of regret:

**Moist Grandmaster:**
*"Over these past years, thanks to your constant tinkering and meddling,
a large number of Song military-industrial complex members
migrated alongside the Mongol herders who left you,
moving through Central and Northern Asia,
and eventually ended up in the Golden Horde."*

Kublai froze, as if stabbed through the heart.

He panted, chest heaving, and finally hoarsely shouted:

**Kublai:**
*"Go! Everyone go!
Tell me—
who do you still value now?!
Make me a list, one by one!"*

He pointed outside the tent, like an old beast-king roaring in his dying moments:

**Kublai:**
*"Since you’re leaving—
**don’t ever come back!**"*

The tent instantly fell into a deathly silence.

Toqta, Kaidu, and Duwa didn’t utter a word—
but each of them wore the expression: *“You said this far too late.”*




## **Act Five**

**Toqta stood up coldly, as if delivering a verdict:**
*"I know when you return, you will tell everyone—
that you have won."*

He turned to Kublai, his tone devoid of hatred, yet carrying a sorrow from the depths of the steppe, almost like a clan elder addressing a child who has lost their way:

**Toqta:**
*"The youngest son of the Torei family, go.
Go back and be your emperor.
If you want to be emperor, then be emperor.
But remember—
**the Mongolian Plateau—you and your descendants will never return.**"*

Kublai froze as if struck; his breath caught.

**Toqta continued, merciless:**
*"You can deceive the Chinese, claim yourself the victor.
You can build palaces, run the imperial exams, paint dragons on thrones, dress in Han court robes.
They will believe you; whatever you say, they will comply."*

Toqta lowered his voice:

*"But what happens when your descendants lose?
When they lose officials, lose cities, lose granaries?"*

He pointed north, toward the vast steppe.

**Toqta:**
*"Mongolia will not support them.
We never will.
They cannot return, and they cannot endure.
They will be crushed between slave uprisings and Mongol battle lines—
**squeezed to death like dogs.**"*

Even the wind in the tent seemed to pause.

Kublai tried to protest, opened his mouth, but no words came out.

**Kaidu sneered:**
*"The emperor is a good thing; once you get used to it, you can’t go back.
We have no emperors; we only have win or lose, life or death.
You want both—your descendants… naturally, they lose both."*

Duwa of the Chagatai Khanate added:

**Duwa:**
*"You Torei family… never considered that you yourselves could be eliminated."*

Kublai’s eyes suddenly welled with tears, but he forced himself to lift his head, letting no one see.

**Kublai (almost brokenly):**
*"…Go.
Go.
All of you, go.
Since you do not want me—
do not ever return."*

Toqta nodded slightly, as if completing the hardest ceremony of his life:

**Toqta:**
*"We will not return.
Rest assured."*

He turned, lifted the tent flap, and the wind and snow poured in.
The cold steppe wind cut through time itself, like a blade tearing eras apart.




**Narrator**

Shortly after returning to the capital of the Great Yuan Mongol Empire, Beijing, Kublai passed away.
The eleven emperors of the Great Yuan Mongol Empire struggled endlessly to reorganize political alliances, trying to prevent the Mongol nomads from fracturing, yet they could not repair the rift in the steppe.

When the Chinese overthrew the empire, few Mongol nomads responded to the court’s call to suppress the uprising.

The Yuan regime was forced to flee to Hohhot and establish a secondary capital, never daring to set foot on the true Mongolian Plateau again.

When the Ming cavalry advanced north, sweeping across the steppe gateways like a storm,
**the Great Yuan Mongol Empire was utterly destroyed.**

The curtain falls.
The End.

**“Cultural Sovereignty · Consensus Network”**

**Post-Glacial Baikal Refuge Groups**

**Historical Context:**
Between roughly **18,000 BCE and 12,000 BCE**, Earth went through a major climatic transition known as the **Post-Glacial Period**. As the glaciers retreated and global temperatures gradually rose, ecosystems around the world underwent dramatic transformations. The **Lake Baikal region**, located in what is now Siberia, Russia, was a key geographic zone during this era. It served not only as one of the crucial refuges for early human settlements, but also as a cradle for various emerging nomadic cultures.



**Origins of the Baikal Refuge Groups:**
As the Ice Age came to an end, vast grasslands, forests, and expansive mountain ranges opened up as activity zones for both humans and animals. The East Asian and North Asian regions surrounding Lake Baikal—especially the cold highlands nearby—became one of the major starting points for large-scale human migrations and cultural development. The people who lived here endured harsh environmental conditions and intense **natural selection pressures**, which pushed them to develop highly efficient survival skills and cultural mechanisms.

The cultural evolution of this group was closely tied to these survival pressures: they had to contend not only with a severe climate but also with competition for resources among diverse neighboring ethnic and cultural groups. These pressures ultimately drove them to form highly flexible and adaptive social structures—structures that would, over the following millennia, spread gradually across different parts of the world through migration.





**Formation of High Elimination and High Narrative:**
Due to the harsh environment of the Baikal region, these populations experienced extremely high rates of elimination. Each generation struggled to survive amid natural disasters, famine, predators, and conflicts among themselves. As a result, individuals within these groups did not grow up casually—they were required to possess exceptional survival intelligence and a remarkable ability to adapt. For this reason, **“narrative”** became a vital component of their culture. **Stories** were not merely tools for entertainment or inheritance; they were instruments of survival and governance, capable of shaping the thoughts, behaviors, and cooperation of the tribe.

During this period, the development of **narrative capacity** became their core advantage on the stage of world history. They were not only transmitters of civilization but also accelerators of its evolution. Through language and storytelling, these groups forged their worldview and used the power of narrative to gain an upper hand in interactions with other cultures.




**Spread of the Civilizational Template:**
After thousands of years of survival struggle, the groups originating from the Lake Baikal region—**the Vikings, the Turkic peoples, the Mongols, the Tungusic peoples, and the Native Americans**—became some of the most mobile populations in the ancient world. As they migrated, they carried their cultural templates to every corner of the globe.

Relying on their powerful nomadic capabilities and flexible cultural structures, these peoples expanded rapidly across the Eurasian continent. Their worldviews, social organization models, power structures, religious beliefs, and cultural transmission mechanisms took root and flourished in diverse regions. In particular, regarding the core concept of cultural sovereignty, they understood the delicate balance between **internal competition** and **external symbiosis**, allowing them to adapt and reorganize quickly among different civilizations, thereby accelerating civilizational development on a global scale.

The cultures and stories of these groups had profound influence on civilizations elsewhere—especially those that had previously existed in relatively enclosed conditions, such as the ancient civilizations of China, India, and the Middle East.




**The Disintegration of Matrilineal Clan Societies**:
As these migrating groups moved deeper into other cultural spheres, they brought more than just material advancements—they introduced profound cultural shifts. Within their social structures, **male roles** often assumed the positions of active leaders and storytellers. Over time, the patrilineal structure, in contrast to matrilineal societies, gradually permeated civilizations across continents. The advantages of this male-centered system were repeatedly confirmed and reinforced through ongoing cultural interactions. Particularly, their superiority in narrative, warfare, and collective organization allowed them to progressively supplant matrilineal-centered social models.

These emerging patrilineal structures extended beyond family or tribal organization, reaching into **social and political** dimensions. As patrilineal culture spread, many civilizations originally dominated by matrilineal systems gradually disintegrated or transformed, forming the early frameworks of modern society.

**Conclusion**:
The cultural influence of the Baikal refuge groups—the Vikings, Turks, Mongols, Tungusic peoples, and Native Americans—has been felt globally. Through their **high survival pressures** and **advanced narrative abilities**, they not only shaped their own societies but also accelerated the development of global civilization. Their migrations were not merely physical movements; they were also vectors of thought and cultural transmission, driving rapid evolution of civilizations across continents in just a few thousand years and gradually shaping today’s global cultural landscape.

These peoples were not only nomadic **conquerors** but also **drivers of global cultural evolution**, leaving an indelible imprint on the world’s cultural, political, and social structures that persists to this day.





**The Essence of the Military-Industrial Complex: Distributed Deliberation and the Driver of Competition**

The military-industrial complex is often seen merely as a vast industrial system serving the needs of war, but its true nature goes far beyond this. It is not simply a technical service group composed of craftsmen, merchants, and physicians; rather, it is a network of individuals and organizations that continually drive thought, innovation, and breakthroughs. These actors do not exist solely to support warfare or military technology—they function, at a deeper level, as a core force propelling social and civilizational evolution.

The greatest strength of the military-industrial complex does not lie in sheer productivity, nor in a singular expression of intelligence, but in its **“distributed capacity for deliberation.”** This capability arises from its structure: whether merchants, artisans, or technical researchers, each explores problems through diverse paths amid continuous thinking, innovation, and competition, thereby stimulating societal creativity. More importantly, the distributed nature of this thinking ensures that each component maintains ongoing competition and constant self-renewal.




### **Distributed Deliberation and Innovation**

This distributed mode of thinking is fundamentally designed to prevent the uniformity of collective thought. A highly centralized organization may operate efficiently in the short term, but it is prone to path dependency, which stifles innovation and breakthrough. In contrast, the multiple layers and structures of the military-industrial complex stimulate countless individuals’ innovative thinking through mutual competition and confrontation. In such a highly competitive environment, traditional and rigid frameworks are disrupted, giving rise to new ideas and technologies.

For example, historically powerful civilizations often experienced periods of intense competition, not only in commerce and warfare but also in the collision of ideas, culture, and politics. It is precisely this **“competition and collision”** that drives the emergence of new ways of thinking, accelerating social transformation and the development of civilization.




### **Interaction Between Diversity and Innovation**

Diversity within the military-industrial complex manifests not only at the level of technology and industry but also in organizational structures and modes of thought. Different organizations engage in both cooperation and competition. This competition is not merely about producing stronger weapons or more advanced technologies; rather, in the process of driving society forward, each party, through constant challenges and confrontation, uncovers more efficient and innovative solutions.

At a deeper level, these competitive relationships between organizations create a mechanism of **“adaptive evolution.”** Each organization or group, like an independent organism, continuously searches for the evolutionary path best suited to its survival and competitiveness. This evolution is not linear but multidimensional. It is precisely this diversity and adaptability that allow society or civilization as a whole to maintain vitality and continually surpass its limitations.




### **The Engine of Social Evolution**

The military-industrial complex, while centered on technological production and warfare, derives its true significance and value from acting as an engine of social evolution through **distributed deliberation** and **diverse competition**. What it drives is not merely military technology, but broader innovations in thought, culture, and technology. Each organization, industry, and individual functions as a node within this vast evolutionary system. Through continual collision and integration, new ideas and technologies emerge.

This model can also be understood as an **adaptive mechanism** for social and civilizational development. Each competitive entity continuously adjusts and optimizes its behavior and strategy during rapid development. This process is not dictated by centralized authority or a single dominant force, but is propelled collectively by multiple independent yet interacting components.

### **Conclusion**

The core of the military-industrial complex is not merely a technical system supporting warfare; at its essence, it is a **“factory of thought”** filled with competition and deliberation. Here, diverse organizations and individuals, through highly distributed reasoning, generate countless innovative ideas and technologies, driving the progress of society as a whole. It represents a model of social evolution that does not rely on the domination or management of a single force, but rather leverages **multidimensional competition and innovation mechanisms** to guide society toward higher levels. This diversity-driven competition not only breaks through old frameworks but also ensures that society continuously adapts, evolves, and innovates.





**The War Logic of Temüjin (Genghis Khan) During the Mongol Empire: Cultural Sovereignty and Territorial Choice**

The war logic of Temüjin (Genghis Khan) was not merely about conquest and expansion; it was fundamentally guided by **“cultural sovereignty”** and **adaptive expansion.”** His strategies were not indiscriminate across all directions, but involved selective annexation and integration based on the cultural characteristics, geographic conditions, and social structures of different regions. The underlying principle of this selective expansion was rooted in a deep understanding of **nomadic culture** and a nuanced knowledge of land and resources.

### **1. Annexing Nomadic Cultural Regions: Unity Through Cultural Sovereignty**

The primary targets of Temüjin’s conquests were regions where nomadic culture constituted the majority of the population. The Mongol Empire’s expansion was not simply aimed at increasing territory or population, but was conducted under the principle of **cultural sovereignty**. Genghis Khan recognized that nomadic peoples were the most adaptable to Mongol-style governance and warfare. Therefore, annexing regions with nomadic cultures—especially tribes that already possessed a certain level of social organization and military capability—was a central strategic objective.

For example, the Mongol attacks on the Jin Dynasty were not only about territorial gain but aimed at dismantling the Jin’s powerful military apparatus, particularly its military-industrial complex represented by the Shatuo. Within this framework of cultural sovereignty, Temüjin not only destroyed the Jin military strength but also ensured the persistence and dominance of nomadic culture in the conquered regions.





### **2. Avoiding the Steppe Wastelands: Adaptation and Resource Constraints**

Although the Mongol Empire expanded across much of the Eurasian continent, Temüjin did not intend to conquer every region. A notable example is his avoidance of the harsh steppe and tundra regions, such as the frigid areas of Siberia, where winter temperatures could reach -40°C. These climates were extremely inhospitable to Mongol herders and cavalry—the survival of cattle and sheep in such cold conditions was nearly impossible, and the Mongol military relied heavily on both its cavalry forces and abundant livestock. Therefore, Temüjin deliberately avoided these resource-scarce and climatically extreme areas.

This exclusion of the wastelands was not only a rational assessment of resources but also reflected Temüjin’s concern for the **sustainability of military strength**. Mongol military power depended on an efficient logistical system and a large supply of livestock, so Temüjin did not waste resources or engage in hopeless battles in regions unsuited to Mongol operations.

### **3. Attitude Toward the Song Empire: Avoiding Attack and Maintaining Distance**

Regarding the Song Empire, Temüjin never demonstrated a strong desire to attack. This was not due to military impossibility, but rather because the Song, as an agrarian empire with a deeply rooted sedentary culture, fundamentally differed from Mongol nomadic culture. Temüjin recognized that such a society was not suitable for integration through conquest. The Song’s efficient administration, advanced agricultural systems, and thriving commerce made it a **sedentary cultural state**, which conflicted with the core logic of Mongol nomadism.

Furthermore, Temüjin did not plan a systematic conquest of the Song akin to his campaigns against the Jin Dynasty, because the Song’s military organization, fortified cities, and large-scale agricultural production meant that such a war would be extremely difficult and costly. For Temüjin, attacking the Song was not just a physical challenge—it posed a profound challenge to **cultural sovereignty**. As a typical sedentary cultural state, the Song’s internal and external structures were completely different from the Mongol Empire. This disparity implied that even if the Song were conquered, maintaining control would be very difficult and offer limited long-term strategic benefit.





### **4. Withdrawal from India: Avoiding Non-Nomadic Cultural Regions**

Temüjin’s brief attempt to conquer India also illustrates his logic of **cultural sovereignty**. During his engagement with India, he realized that the religious and social structures there were fundamentally at odds with Mongol nomadic culture, particularly due to the caste system and the established religious hierarchy. Confronted with such a complex situation, Temüjin ordered a halt to massacres and an immediate withdrawal. This decision demonstrated his acute sensitivity to **cultural adaptability**. The Mongol Empire’s expansion logic was not indiscriminate conquest; rather, it focused on identifying regions compatible with its own cultural system for integration and governance.

### **5. Relationship with Viking Culture: Alliance and Coexistence**

Temüjin’s relationship with Viking culture was complex, but overall, he did not pursue direct conquest or annexation of Viking-controlled territories. The influence of Vikings and their descendants in Scandinavia and Western Europe did not conflict with the Mongol nomadic culture; in some areas, it even offered potential complementarities. Temüjin deliberately chose to form alliances with the Vikings, engage in trade, and accelerate mutual exchange and cultural interaction. This approach reflects Genghis Khan’s **openness within the framework of cultural sovereignty**—he did not seek to sever connections with culturally compatible groups, but rather aimed to maximize benefits through cooperation and coexistence.






### **6. Interactions Between the Golden Horde and Western Europe: Cultural Sovereignty and Diplomatic Policy**

The Golden Horde’s approach to Western Europe differed somewhat from the expansion strategies of other Mongol tribes. Its engagements with Western Europe, particularly wars against France and Spain, may superficially appear politically or militarily motivated, but the deeper rationale lay in considerations of **cultural sovereignty**. The Golden Horde understood that its relationship with Western Europe was shaped not only through warfare but also through **cultural consensus and shared interests**. By establishing stable trade and diplomatic relations in Western Europe, the Golden Horde effectively maintained its status as a **“culturally sovereign state,”** ensuring that its existence would not be easily undermined by foreign cultures.

### **Conclusion**

During Temüjin’s era, the Mongol Empire did not expand blindly; it followed a strict logic of cultural sovereignty, selectively annexing regions dominated by nomadic culture while avoiding areas incompatible with its own cultural system. In doing so, the Mongols preserved their cultural independence and, through cooperation and exchange with other cultures, accelerated civilizational progress. Temüjin and his successors pursued warfare not merely to conquer territory, but to **guarantee the survival and development of Mongol nomadic culture** in a complex and ever-changing world.





**The Evolution of the Shatuo Military-Political Group in the Song State and Its Conflict with Mongol Cultural Sovereignty:**

In the 10th century, the Shatuo military-political group of the Song state underwent a profound institutional evolution, marking a shift from a traditional military-dominated system to a **logistics-driven war model**. This transformation was not merely an adjustment of military power but a fundamental change in social structure, political organization, and the nature of warfare. It ultimately laid the groundwork for the rise of the Mongol Empire and the assertion of its cultural sovereignty. However, this evolution also introduced unprecedented risks, even becoming one of the sources of internal contradictions for the Mongol Empire.

### **1. The 10th-Century Transformation of the Shatuo Military-Political Group: Rise of the Logistics-Driven War Model**

At the founding of the Song Dynasty, the Shatuo military-political group relied on its powerful cavalry and military-industrial complex—especially iron production and bow manufacturing—to maintain rule and expand influence. However, as society became more complex and the demands of warfare evolved, the Shatuo group gradually moved away from the traditional military framework, shifting toward a model emphasizing **logistical support, resource integration, and technological development**.

At the core of this transformation was the redefinition of combatants’ roles—from being “pure warriors” to becoming **integral components of a logistics support system**. In other words, military strength no longer depended solely on the bravery of soldiers but increasingly on resource allocation, equipment development, and technological innovation. Under this model, soldiers were no longer the sole focus of military power; instead, they were considered part of a **war machine** reliant on the broader society’s economic and technological support. This made the military-industrial complex crucial, and the optimization of resources and soldier productivity became decisive factors in determining the outcomes of war.

The advantages of this strategy were clear: with abundant resources, a logistics-driven war model could allow a nation’s military apparatus to operate efficiently over prolonged conflicts, gradually accumulating strategic advantages. Yet the model also carried inherent risks. **Resource shortages could create bottlenecks in logistical supply**, directly impacting the progress of war and the combat effectiveness of the army.





### **2. Displaced Soldiers: Transformation into Agents of Mongol Cultural Sovereignty**

As the logistics-driven model of the Shatuo military-political group matured, traditional combatants—those nomadic warriors reliant on cavalry—were gradually phased out of the mainstream military system. These displaced soldiers did not disappear; rather, they became pivotal drivers of **Mongol cultural sovereignty**.

The establishment of the Mongol Empire, particularly under the leadership of Temüjin (Genghis Khan), relied heavily on these warriors who had experienced the Shatuo group’s institutional transformation. Mongol cavalry, organizational methods, and logistical systems were in many ways **products of the Shatuo evolution**. These formerly marginalized soldiers, carrying deep understanding of traditional military systems, became the architects of the Mongol Empire’s rise, creating a unique warfare logic rooted in nomadic culture. They not only translated combat experience into cavalry mobility but also applied **logistics-driven thinking** to Mongol military expansion.

However, this rapid military and cultural transformation also generated human apprehension about **overly fast institutional evolution**. The success of the Mongol Empire was not based solely on force; it lay in establishing a system capable of swiftly adapting to and controlling wartime conditions. Yet the transformation was so rapid that later rulers, such as Kublai Khan, experienced profound anxiety and unease when confronting the sheer scale of the empire’s expansion.

### **3. 13th Century: Fear of Over-Evolution and Kublai Khan’s Collapse**

By the 13th century, the Mongol Empire’s cultural sovereignty and military power had reached unprecedented heights. Yet as the empire expanded, Kublai Khan and other rulers gradually felt the pressure and unease generated by such rapid evolution. Especially during the empire’s transition from a nomadic confederation to a vast imperial structure, the speed of military, logistical, and cultural integration induced deep anxiety in Kublai.

Kublai’s collapse was not merely due to external threats but stemmed from **loss of control over cultural sovereignty and military governance**. Confronted with a complex international political environment, internal social adjustments, and evolving military demands, Kublai realized that the Mongol institutional evolution had far outpaced his personal ability to manage it. Faced with competition from other tribes and clans, he and his successors began questioning whether they could maintain absolute control over the empire.

Kublai’s fear was less about external enemies and more about the **uncontrollable speed of institutional evolution**, apprehensive that the military-industrial complex could ultimately dominate the empire’s destiny. This fear of over-evolution gradually undermined the stability of Mongol imperial rule.





### **4. Historical Lesson from the Mongol Empire: Wanting to Leverage the Military-Industrial Complex but Fearing Its Control**

Kublai Khan was not the first to attempt to use the military-industrial complex to expand his own power. He recognized that the strength of the military-industrial complex was not merely physical force; it also represented the **continuity and control of cultural sovereignty**. Once this power slipped out of the ruler’s control, it could become extraordinarily potent, even acting contrary to the ruler’s intentions.

This phenomenon is particularly evident in the history of the Mongol Empire. While Genghis Khan successfully built a formidable empire, over time imperial control gradually became unbalanced, and the influence of the military-industrial complex began to expand, emerging as a potential threat to the rulers. Kublai Khan’s collapse was an almost inevitable consequence of this evolutionary process.

**Summary:**

The 10th-century evolution of the Shatuo military-political group in the Song state not only brought a military transformation but also laid the groundwork for the rise of the Mongol Empire. However, behind this rapid evolution lurked enormous risks and fears, especially for rulers attempting to leverage the military-industrial complex to expand their power. The speed of institutional evolution ultimately created an **uncontrollable situation** in the Mongol Empire, forcing emperors such as Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan to confront a harsh reality: the power of the military-industrial complex was so great that it could potentially overwhelm their own rule.




### **The Evolution of Unified Civilizational Structures and Depth of Thought**

The evolution and development of civilization are fundamentally based on a core structural template that runs through all of human history—from the earliest nomadic tribes to modern capitalist, socialist, and communist systems. The essence of this structural template does not lie in superficial differences, but in the **depth of thought and modes of calculation**. In other words, whether it is the global expansion of capitalism or the experiments of socialism and communism, all ultimately follow the same underlying logic, manifesting differently across time and context.

### **1. A Unified Civilizational Structural Template**

Viewed holistically, the development of human civilization is a process of collective cognitive evolution. The different paths taken by various civilizations and nations all occur within the same structural framework. This framework is not determined purely by political, economic, or cultural factors, but is shaped by the **depth of human thought and the patterns of thinking**.

The earliest nomadic societies represent the prototype of this civilizational template. At the core of nomadic culture lies a highly flexible adaptability and distributed management system—through population distribution, warfare, and control of resources, they created a robust system for survival and competition. The high mobility and decentralized organizational forms of nomadic cultures laid the foundation for later civilizational forms. They facilitated the transition of human societies from loosely organized tribal systems toward more complex agricultural, industrial, and eventually modern globalized societies.





### **2. Depth of Thought and the Evolution of the Three Major Theories**

The three major humanistic theories—capitalism, socialism, and communism—are essentially different levels of response to the same underlying question, or reflections of varying depths of thought on the development of civilization. Their corresponding ideologies and practical models do not evolve independently, but originate from a shared foundation: **nomadic logic**. This can be observed in the basic operational patterns of different social systems:

* **Capitalism**: The emergence of capitalism was not accidental, but the result of millennia of distributed human thought, competition, and cooperation. From resource competition in nomadic cultures, to land ownership in agricultural societies, and the control of machine productivity during the Industrial Revolution, capitalism reflects humanity’s continual optimization of resource allocation and productive management. In capitalist societies, wealth and power are dispersed, and the market itself functions like a highly adaptive nomadic system, adjusting its rules according to changes in the external environment. The fundamental logic of capitalism is the optimal allocation of resources through free competition in the market.

* **Socialism and Communism**: In contrast to capitalism, the more centralized management models of socialism and communism can be seen as an extension of **collective thinking in nomadic culture**. They do not completely depart from nomadic logic; rather, they concentrate resources and wealth in a short period to implement ideals of equality or social welfare on a larger scale. The essence of socialism remains rooted in the collective nomadic mindset, emphasizing decision-making and resource allocation by a small elite group over a short timeframe. While this approach does not achieve long-term prosperity through widespread distributed thought and competition as capitalism does, it still operates within the framework of nomadic culture.





### **3. Nomadic Logic and the Universality of Civilization Development**

The essence of nomadic logic does not lie in the nomadic lifestyle itself, but in the mindset it represents: **distributed management and competition, rapid adaptation and reorganization, and prioritizing collective interests over individual ones**. This logic manifests in different forms across various civilizations and historical periods, but at its core, it drives a model of survival, prosperity, and development. Whether it is an agrarian empire or a modern state driven by capital, each reflects, to some degree, the cognitive structures of nomadic societies.

These theories—capitalism, socialism, and communism—ultimately attempt to address the same fundamental question: **how to maintain competitiveness and survival in an increasingly complex society, while ensuring rational resource allocation and social stability**. The depth of these ideas lies not in their differences, but in how they reflect the evolving forms of social management and organization, as well as humanity’s ongoing exploration of “modes of survival.”

### **4. Conclusion: The Ultimate Structural Template of Civilization**

Ultimately, the evolution of civilization does not emerge from the collision of multiple independent templates, but from a deep evolution within a unified structural template. The ideological and practical systems of capitalism, socialism, and communism are merely different expressions of this template under varying historical conditions and societal needs. They are not disconnected categories, but diverse manifestations evolving within the same framework.

This explains why, no matter how humans innovate or transform, civilizations are ultimately attempting to answer the same core question: **how to manage resources, organize society, and ensure survival and development**. The depth of this inquiry converges on a similar structural logic, whose core principle is: **how to maintain order amid competition and pursue better survival and prosperity within that order**.





**Analysis of the Military-Industrial Complex Evolution During the Black Death (1347–1351)**

During the Black Death that swept across Europe, the military-industrial complex underwent yet another profound structural evolution. At this time, much of Europe was under the **cultural sovereignty of the Golden Horde and Viking-derived royal houses**. Political structures were relatively stable, but dense populations and social order were severely disrupted by the pandemic, putting traditional military-industrial templates under extreme stress. The introduction of the Song dynasty’s military-industrial model to Europe forced the complex to adopt a new **logistics-driven organizational model**: soldiers were gradually removed from the core system, leaving the military-industrial apparatus centered on highly specialized **artisans and merchants**.

However, a system composed solely of artisans and merchants **lacked internal competition mechanisms**, making it prone to innovation stagnation or systemic imbalance. In this structure, conventional methods were insufficient to respond to a large-scale plague—the army and religious institutions could not quickly adapt to maintain social order or control disease spread.

The Black Death outbreak from 1347 to 1351 marked the first explicit activation of the **consensus network under cultural sovereignty**. Royal houses and lords simultaneously **ordered the Church to remain silent**, forbidding interference with epidemic response measures, and instructed the military-industrial complex to rapidly evolve in logistics and medical capacities. Under this institutional protection, a new profession—the **physician**—emerged in Europe: they were deployed to the hardest-hit regions of Italy, while French medical schools sent large numbers of doctors to participate in treatment and epidemic prevention.

During this period, the evolution of the military-industrial complex displayed three key characteristics:

1. **Logistics-driven structure**: The role of soldiers was stripped away, leaving artisans and merchants at the core, focusing on production, supply, and technological maintenance.
2. **Cross-cultural integration**: The combination of the Song military-industrial template with European systems endowed institutions with adaptability in the face of extreme epidemics.
3. **Institutional innovation driven by new professions**: The rise of physicians not only mitigated the impact of the plague but also became a symbol of the military-industrial complex’s capacity to expand under the framework of cultural sovereignty, generating new systemic competition and evolutionary momentum.

The Black Death was not only a demographic catastrophe but also a **catalyst for the evolution of the military-industrial complex**. Protected by cultural sovereignty and a logistics-driven structure, medical, logistical, and social organizational models rapidly adapted, laying the institutional foundation necessary for Europe’s future modern civilization development.





The integrated **Shatu military-political complex** had, by the mid-14th century, fully embedded itself into the European political landscape. They did not appear out of nowhere; rather, they continued the long-standing tradition of mixed ancestry that stretched westward from Lake Baikal and the Mongolian Plateau across the Eurasian steppes. Late-era Mongol genealogical records often mention descriptors such as “gray eyes,” “red hair,” and “fair skin.” Genghis Khan himself, with his blue-gray eyes, reddish-brown hair, and robust physique, was not uncommon in the Mongol lineage of the time. By the time they reached Europe, this mixed-race appearance only needed a new set of language and clothing to blend into the vague European impressions of “Highlanders,” “Steppe People,” or “Northern Knights,” without being recognized as foreign rulers.

Although their overall appearance gradually “Europeanized,” about 30% of the members still retained distinct Mongolian traits—wide cheekbones, black hair, dark eyes, and yellowish undertones. However, with several generations of intermixing, each successive generation in the European environment diluted these features further, leaving only **“black hair and Eastern-style facial contours”** as their most stable identifying markers.

When the Shatu system formed its new military-industrial complex structure in the 14th century—a **logistics-driven civilization integrating artisans, physicians, and merchants**—they immediately recognized a fundamental problem:
**They needed a permanent node that would not threaten their logistics lines and had a high concentration of ports.**

This ruled out France and Italy, which were too politically entangled;
it also ruled out Germany, a classic “land of four wars,” lacking deep-water ports necessary for sustaining their “maritime logistics civilization.”

Therefore, starting in 1348, consensus gradually emerged within the European Shatu complex:
**The truly suitable location for establishing a central node was England.**




England’s conditions were almost as if they had been prearranged:

* The **Black Death (1348–1349)** caused a mortality rate of 40–45% on English soil, far higher than Germany’s approximate 20–25%;
* Urban labor was extremely scarce;
* The king, under existential pressure, had to accept institutional reforms more audacious than those elsewhere in Europe;
* Coastal trade ports were densely distributed (London, Bristol, York, Newcastle, etc.);
* Coupled with the natural corridors connecting the Viking cultural sphere and the Golden Horde, England became the region most likely to accept foreign skills and institutions.

Starting **in 1351**, England first raised wages in London, Norfolk, and York, importing **port artisan groups from the Viking trade networks** as entire units, paying them three times the rate of local craftsmen. About one-third of these newcomers carried East Asian ancestry—this was the fixed proportion in the logistics-driven military-industrial system, as they were responsible for precision crafts and medical infrastructure.

Thus, in just thirty years from **1350–1380**, the northeast coast of England, southern suburbs of London, and parts of Cornwall experienced a **marked increase in the density of black-haired populations**. Norfolk County parish records even noted a peculiar statistic: “Among the new artisan population, black-haired individuals outnumber the local brown-haired residents.”

These regions later became:

* The initial technical core of the English navy,
* The industrial foundation of the Tudor dynasty,
* And the starting point for England’s rise to maritime power in the 16th century.





As the class of doctors took the stage forcefully during the Black Death, Europe’s previously stable spiritual order was fundamentally torn apart. Neighbors watched in shock as people in black robes and crow-like masks saved patients, while the clergy could only burn incense, pray, and stand helplessly by. **Religious authority was empirically disproven for the first time**, sparking the tinderbox for the continent-wide Reformation.
And from the royal courts to local lords, everyone understood: this collapse was no accident—it was a byproduct of structural changes in the military-industrial complex.

### **Old Faith – New Faith – Royals – Merchants: Four-Way Struggle**

When the emergence of doctors severed the Church’s monopoly on “salvation,” Europe’s political order immediately destabilized:

* **Old Faith (Roman Curia)** sought to re-consolidate power;
* **New Faith (Reformers)** seized the moment to establish legitimacy;
* **Merchants** sensed a power vacuum;
* **Royals** leveraged the opportunity to expand their sovereignty.

Wars erupted one after another: from the Hussite Wars to Peasants’ Revolts, from the independence of the Swiss Confederation to the bloody struggles between old and new nobility.

### **Simultaneously, the Mongol Golden Lineages Fractured**

The Mongol world of the 14th century was similarly splintering:
Multi-front civil wars among the Ögedei, Chagatai, Golden Horde, and Ilkhanate lines had destabilized **cultural sovereignty**—the integrated Eurasian military-political system.
**Chaos engulfed both ends of the Eurasian continent**, and the logistics-driven civilization framework of the military-industrial complex lost its foothold.

The conclusion was clear:
**The node must be relocated.**

### **The Next Primary Node: England**




After the Black Death, England experienced a sharp population decline and an acute labor shortage, prompting it to offer high wages and import large numbers of craftsmen and doctors directly through the Viking trade networks.
Soon, **records show a sudden increase in the proportion of dark-haired people in some port cities**—noted by clergy as a “wave of foreign artisans.”
This was not “immigration” in the conventional sense, but **the military-industrial complex repositioning its pieces**.

By the early 15th century, London, Bristol, and Southampton had become the nascent forms of new “nodes.”

### **To Stop Europe’s Suicidal Multi-Front Wars: Attention Must Be Redirected**

At that time, the military-industrial complex had already realized:
**If Europe continued its four-way conflicts, even relocating the node to England would not be sustainable.**

They therefore decided to employ a “state-level decoy” strategy long used by the Song dynasty:
**Create a bigger adventure.**

But a fundamental problem arose:
**Europe had no demand for long-distance maritime ventures.**

While late Song shipbuilding technology had long-range potential, all European trade routes remained confined to the Mediterranean and North Seas. No one needed fifty-meter-long ships, and no one was interested in exploration akin to crossing planets.

### **If the Demand Doesn’t Exist, Manufacture It**

Thus unfolded a classic scene that has been repeated ever since:

**The royal networks began “marketing the Orient.”**





Marco Polo’s *Travels to the East* was wildly reprinted, rewritten, and polished throughout the 14th and 15th centuries.
Suddenly, the book became **Europe’s first piece of “state propaganda.”**

The royal courts, merchants, and theologians collectively painted a dream for the populace: China (their imagined “Cathay”) was described as:

* A land paved with gold,
* Silk as cheap as sand,
* A distant place with every resource capable of changing one’s fate.

They were fully aware of the reality:
After the collapse of the Mongol Empire, East Asia had explicitly rejected further intervention from the military-industrial complex, as **“the pace of evolution exceeded their capacity to absorb it.”**
But refusal did not mean re-entry was impossible.

**Thus, the Age of Discovery was effectively switched on.**

### **Song Shipbuilding Technology + Military-Industrial Complex Needs = A True Ocean-Going Fleet**

Song dynasty ships of a thousand tons were built for coastal trade and monsoon navigation, but the technology was already there:

* Watertight bulkheads
* Compass navigation
* Large sail rigs
* Multi-masted structures

Europe only needed minor adaptations to build vessels capable of crossing the Atlantic.

Shipyards mushroomed across England and the Iberian Peninsula.
The official explanation: “trade expansion.”
For the military-industrial complex, this was **a probe for new logistical routes and entirely new global nodes.**

### **Ultimately, the Americas Emerged**

The Age of Discovery was not accidental.
It was more like:
**A forced migration of civilization, driven by overcrowded European battlefields, religious collapse, and the breakdown of the Eurasian system.**

The Americas were not “discovered”; they were **“sought out.”**
The Old World could no longer accommodate a military-industrial complex in the midst of restructuring.




Although Portugal and Spain were the first to reap the rewards of the Age of Discovery, within the framework of the military-industrial complex, these two countries were always merely **“risk-bearing executors.”**
**The military-industrial complex possesses the capability to defeat any enemy 100%, but not the necessity to intervene personally 100% of the time.**
This logic had been maintained for thousands of years—
**others bear the risk, yet the ultimate gains return to the complex and the sovereigns it is symbiotic with.**

Portugal and Spain’s “pioneer” status did not mean they were truly at the evolutionary acceleration point; it simply meant they were willing to take risks—and risk-takers rarely live long.

---

## **Britain’s Mutation: Internal Recombination**

When Britain began proactively raising wages in the late Black Death period and importing high-density migrants (including a large number who “understood logistical logic”), its social structure itself began to mutate.
**The Roman Curia realized its spiritual control over England was failing—but it could not stop it.**

In 1534, Henry VIII established the Church of England—
This was a nuclear strike against the entire European political structure:

* Religious sovereignty was directly reclaimed by the king
* The Papacy lost its legal authority over England
* England gained unrestricted freedom to engage in naval warfare, piracy, and armed merchant ventures

This step, a reconstruction from religion to sovereignty, effectively **reconnected England with its Viking maritime tradition.**





## **Spain’s Anger and Mistake: The Illusion of Wealth**

Spain plundered massive amounts of silver and gold from South America, believing itself at the center of the world.
But silver did not bring power—it brought **the illusion of power**.
The immense wealth pushed Spain to build the “Invincible Armada,” aiming to establish absolute dominance on both land and sea in Europe.

However, the logic of the military-industrial complex at sea is entirely different from that on land:

* The ocean has no borders
* Victory is not determined by numbers
* Technology, flexibility, and speed **are the measure of combat power**
* And the most crucial point:
  **The sea belongs to the nomads**

---

## **England’s Counter-Logic Victory: Transplanting Nomadic Land Logic to the Sea**

At the time, England’s fleet was small and, in the eyes of European nobles, “lacked aesthetics and nobility.”
Yet England did something other nations dared not:

### **1. Transplanting “Nomadic Warfare Logic” to the Sea**

* The king did not bear all the risk
* Nobles did not monopolize power
* Anyone could participate in maritime plunder

### **2. Issuing Letters of Marque**

This effectively told the nation:
*"If you dare to fight, pay taxes on the loot, the rest is yours. The King provides legal cover for you."*

Revolutionary at the time, the Roman Curia and European royal networks denounced England as “barbaric and crude,”
but their scolding was merely another form of jealousy.

### **3. England’s Fleet Focused on Efficiency, Distribution, and Decentralization, Not Uniformity**

Like a distributed military-industrial system at sea, it did not rely on “big ships for shock effect,” but on:

* Small, fast vessels
* Flexible routes
* Well-trained crews
* Decentralized command
* Mixed teams of merchants and sailors

This was a textbook manifestation of **logistics-driven civilization logic** applied to the ocean.

---

## **1588: The Moment Everyone Fell Silent**

When England, in 1588, defeated Spain’s “Invincible Armada” with a fleet that appeared chaotic, the European aristocracy realized for the first time:

> True power does not come from a uniform appearance—it comes from a unified logic.

England’s victory proved that:

* Maritime dominance does not belong to the country with the most resources
* Nor to the Roman Curia that claimed divine blessing
* It belongs to the sovereign that masters distributed warfare logic

The Roman Curia’s scolding disappeared, Spain’s illusion of wealth was shattered,
and England officially became the **primary node of the military-industrial complex in Europe**.

The true winner of the Age of Discovery was never the first to depart,
but the last country to configure its structure into a **sustainably accelerated mode**.





Today, when many people hear the terms “military-industrial complex” or “deep state,” their minds automatically conjure up images straight out of an agrarian civilization fantasy—
as if simply controlling the levers of world power should naturally mean endless feasts and nightly revelry;
meals eaten plate by plate, poured glass by glass;
wine drunk bottle by bottle, splashed without care;
children sent to elite schools, and a sense of “superiority” sold by the pound.

They sense some kind of force behind the scenes, yet imagine it in the cheapest way possible—
the logic of “the more you possess, the more successful you are.”

But the true military-industrial complex, evolving from the Mohist era to today, has always cared about only one thing:
**whether it can reach the next level of meaning.**

It’s not about indulgence, luxury, or noble airs.
They are the ones feeling forward on the ladder of evolution, paying immense costs with no end in sight.
Even though the nodes today are millions of times larger than in the past, that never means anyone can join by imitation—
**cheap imitators only learn the shell; they have no idea what lies at the core.**

The real threshold has never been written down,
and it will never be lowered for anyone.





Stage Play Fish and Bear’s Paw

Time: November 1782
Location: Unknown (we only describe the structural history)
Characters: Representative of the Freemasons vs. Representative of the British Royal Family



### **Act I**

**Scene:**
Inside a dimly lit meeting room, two important figures sit across from each other at a long wooden table.
There are no wine glasses on the table; the air is thick with tension.
Cold, damp London fog presses against the windows, and only a few flickering candles give the room any light.
The outside world feels entirely irrelevant — all attention is drawn to the two opposing representatives.

---

**Royal Representative**
(breaking the silence, impatient)
Why rebel? Didn’t the Glorious Revolution promise you that the Crown would withdraw from the decision-making chain?
You’ve helped Britain dominate for years, and Britain hasn’t treated you unfairly.
You’re already practically autonomous — must you really establish your *own* country?

---

**Freemason Representative**
(calm, slightly mocking)
Because of cultural sovereignty.
Under cultural sovereignty, there are no bloodlines, no ethnicities, no nobility, no royalty.
The Crown may have stepped back, but the royal network has been restraining us for years, constantly slowing evolution.
You compromised — yet you refuse to let go.




**Royal Representative**
(angry, rises to his feet, pointing at the other)
Don’t you realize you’ve evolved *too fast*?
How many years has it been since your ancestors immigrated to Britain? And now you’re already trying to get rid of the monarchy again.
You say “let go” as if it’s easy.
You want me to become a commoner — yet *you* hold a title yourself.
So what, you want to be a commoner too?

---

**Freemason Representative**
(calm, steady)
Evolution means elimination.
Under nomadic culture, there is no such thing as a cheap ascent.
You may take the titles back anytime — we have no use for them.

---

**Royal Representative**
(stunned, sits back down abruptly, murmurs)
Then… why are you in such a hurry?
If this tears apart, the empire’s entire interests will collapse.
What do you want — a nation, or power?

---

**Freemason Representative**
(smiles lightly)
Still don’t see it?
We don’t need hegemony.
We want freedom — the freedom to stand on the world stage unbound by bloodlines, nobility, or religion.
The monarchy and the aristocracy are outdated vessels that must be discarded.
Right now, your only remaining role… is to complete our historical progression.






**Royal Representative**
(angry, voice trembling)
You people have never truly understood the power of the Crown.
You hide your hunger for power behind these so-called “noble ideals.”
Do you really think the British people would abandon everything to follow your “cultural sovereignty”?
You’re nothing but another breed of barbarian —
Perhaps it’s time to find a *new* emperor, not simply tear everything down!

---

**Freemason Representative**
(lets out a cold laugh)
You’re right — the Crown *is* powerful,
but only because you’ve controlled people’s minds.
Your aristocratic system is a relic of history,
and it no longer fits this new world.
Your “emperor” has become a symbol of the past.
What we seek is for every person to have rights —
not to let one family rule across generations.
Old dynasties like yours are obstacles to the age.

---

**Royal Representative**
(leaps to his feet, pacing quickly)
Your so-called “cultural sovereignty” — that’s your nonsense!
And your notion of freedom?
Is it letting merchant-lords and self-made nobles like you run wild and control everything?
If you preach equality,
why do we see your wealth, influence, and power swelling day by day?

---

**Freemason Representative**
(calm, solemn)
You misunderstand.
We don’t seek to shuffle wealth around for fun.
We seek a world where everyone can compete freely according to their abilities
and create greater value.
Instead of clinging to your obsolete shackles of power,
you might as well take a gamble —
embrace a future that is flexible and full of possibilities.
The only thing left for you…
is to step off the stage of history.





**Royal Representative**
(slaps the table in anger)
You people dare to hide your desire to control the world behind the banner of liberalism!
You speak of “evolution,” but all you’re doing is using technology, capital, and secrecy to push your commercial empire forward — to rule everything!
Your so-called “cultural sovereignty” is nothing more than a new mask you’ve put on yourselves!

---

**Freemason Representative**
(bows his head slightly, calm)
You’re right — this is more than a superficial power struggle.
We are simply the force that accelerates change.
You don’t have to accept it,
but the wheel of history does not stop,
even if you resist with all your might.
You will forever struggle in the shadows of the past,
unable to embrace the future.

---

**Royal Representative**
(after a moment of silence, voice low)
Once the wheel of history moves, no one can halt it.
You have indeed found a way to break me.
But your “freedom” will destroy everything.
And the cost of that destruction…
is not something you can bear.

---

**Freemason Representative**
(stands, eyes firm)
The cost has always been inevitable.
And we are ready to face it.
History only moves forward
for those who dare to embrace the future.






## **Act II**

**Scene:**
The same dim meeting room.
Morning light slips through the heavy curtains in thin, cold lines.
The candles on the table have been relit; the air is still heavy.
The Royal Representative looks as if he hasn’t slept — hair slightly disheveled.
The Freemason Representative remains steady, composed, unshaken.

---

**Royal Representative**
(speaks with restraint, tired, reluctant)
I owe you an apology… for what I said yesterday.
Originally… you could have wiped us out, just as you did in East Asia.
If an emperor refused to obey, an entire kingdom could be burned to ash.
Why didn’t you do the same in Britain?

---

**Freemason Representative**
(pushes a folder aside lightly; tone calm but razor-sharp)
Because there was no chance of winning.

He pauses — as if reminding the Royal Representative:
what saved you was not our mercy,
but your geography and your structure.

---

**Freemason Representative**
(continues)
In East Asia, our bases were outside the imperial core —
or on the frontier —
zones completely under our control.
If an emperor hindered evolution,
we could shut down the entire system at any time.

But coming to Europe…
that was a decision where **over-rapid evolution dragged us straight into risk**.

We didn’t think it through:

— your geopolitical structure is different
— your influence networks are deeply entrenched
— your mode of rule makes “replacing the royal house” absurdly costly

You are not the Song Empire.
You are not a node that can be cut off with a single stroke.






Here’s the English translation, keeping the dramatic weight and emotional subtlety:

---

**Freemason Representative**
(sighs softly — an extremely rare display of emotion)
In truth, evolving too fast made us pay a price.
After we left, East Asia entered a **frozen state of refusing evolution**.
For us, that was a failed evolutionary experiment.

---

He lifts his head and looks directly at the Royal Representative.

**Freemason Representative:**
So we reflected on it —
the tearing, the rupture between evolutionary speed
and the capacity of people to withstand it
must not be repeated.

This time, we will not try to destroy you,
nor dismantle your royal network.

On the contrary—
**we’ve decided to build a new region,
a node that can run an entirely new civilizational template on its own.**
A place to pull away all the risk, experimentation,
and evolutionary pressure from the European mainland.

---

The candlelight flickers.
Both men fall silent for a moment.
The Royal Representative realizes
this is their last chance
to be “kept inside history.”





**Act III**

**Scene:**
The same hall, but the air has shifted — from the taut tension of midnight to the oppressive clarity of early morning.
A pot of cold black tea sits untouched on the table.
The Royal Representative sits as if carrying the exhaustion of all Europe on his back;
the Freemason Representative remains composed, with that same “seeing the entire board” calm.

---

**Royal Representative**
(as if pouring out decades of bitterness in one breath, tone tinged with a self-mockery of someone who has burned all bridges):
Yes… the Song Dynasty.

In the 10th century, the Vikings had just come south and taken control of Europe.
And the Song’s goods — textiles, tea, porcelain, ironware, paper, even entertainment products —
poured endlessly through the Arabian Peninsula and flooded into Europe.
More and more in quantity, richer and richer in variety, like a tide we could never push back.

The gold and silver we struggled so hard to seize were drained away in the blink of an eye.
You know… the “royal network” was really just a temporary patchwork from that era —
a forced compromise to keep our finances functioning and society from collapsing.

We never had the time to purge the entrenched old nobility.
All we could do was marry them, absorb them, stitch them into the system.

And the Church?
We pushed their heads down and forced them to release knowledge.
Forced them to tolerate universities, to tolerate scholars.
Why? Because we had to train lawyers, accountants, engineers…
Otherwise Europe could never catch up with the speed of the Song Empire.

Europe was already gasping for air.
Then you arrived again — this time with the Mongol Empire.

Half of Europe… died.
And later we learned you killed even more in East Asia.

(He lifts his head — his gaze as exhausted as an ancient stone wall worn by a thousand winters.)
Now we want to negotiate with you:
**how do we each take a step back?**

---

**Freemason Representative**
(responding in a short, razor-sharp line):
Name your bottom line.





**Royal Representative:**
Don’t destroy the royal network.
Don’t force everyone into risky evolution.
Let every system keep at least one dignified path.

You know exactly what I mean.
Once your cultural-sovereignty template runs at full capacity, it will kill every royal network in existence.

And—
those who don’t want to compete,
those who fail in competition…
they still need somewhere to go.

Didn’t East Asia freeze its evolution precisely because too many people died?

---

(A brief silence in the air — like two civilizations weighing each other’s costs.)

---

**Freemason Representative**
(speaking slowly, as if announcing a new law):
Agreed.

We can wear the mask.
We can run only the Song Empire template, and not the cultural-sovereignty template.

—But there are conditions.

---

**Royal Representative**
(immediately looking up):
Speak.

---

**Freemason Representative:**
**Britain must never betray us.**
Never turn and bite us back.

Secondly—
Britain must permit guilds, enterprises, and individuals to freely migrate to America.
No obstruction.
No stripping of nationality or welfare.
No letting the failures rot on the streets.

If they fail, they must be allowed to return to Britain with dignity.
Because a *safe exit* is an essential buffer for our civilization.

And understand this:
Once you agree, we will begin hollowing Britain out —
shifting technology, capital, and talent outward until another node matures.

That cost… you must be able to bear it.

---

**Royal Representative**
(falling silent, breath catching — as if the future of an entire dynasty is pressing onto his chest):
…






### **Act IV**

The morning fog has not yet lifted. A low fire burns in the small hall’s fireplace.
The Royal Representative and the Freemason Representative sit facing each other once again.
A fresh stack of parchment lies on the table, but the air still holds the residue of last night’s arguments.

**Royal Representative**
(looking tired, yet maintaining aristocratic restraint):
“In North America… what template will you run?”

**Freemason Representative**
(voice calm, as if explaining a law of nature):
“Democracy.”

The Royal Representative frowns, as though he has just heard something absurd.

**Royal Representative:**
“The Athenian thing?
That lottery-and-slogans direct democracy?”

**Freemason Representative:**
“No. We don’t need chaos.
What we want is **a Roman-style civic democracy** —
a system with clear hierarchy, clear responsibilities, and clearly defined rights,
one capable of carrying large-scale projects.”

The Royal Representative leans back against his chair, as if trying to determine whether the other man is mocking him.

**Royal Representative:**
“And what about you?
If you do this, aren’t you exposing your existence directly?”

**Freemason Representative**
(chuckles softly):
“No.
In the past, we coexisted with our proxies —
the empire gave us seventy percent of its real authority.
But every time the proxies rebelled, they had to drag the lower classes with them.
Every purge became a city-level massacre.”






He paused, looking out at the gray-white sky:

“Now it’s different.
This time, we are **taking 100% control**.”

The royal representative’s hand froze for a moment beneath the table.

**The Freemason representative continued:**
“Agents will be selected from the citizenry through a procedural system—
layer by layer,
each level filtering out the disobedient.
Those truly capable of challenging us will be locked outside the structure as well.”

He raised his eyes to look at the royal representative:

“Even if unexpected situations arise, they are easy to manage.
Because—the people will no longer rise against us alongside the agents.”

**Royal representative (in a low voice):**
“You’ve turned ‘freedom’ into a template… to avoid being backstabbed again?”

**Freemason representative:**
“Pursuing freedom is not a slogan.
It is **the prerequisite for evolution**.
A group that doesn’t even dare to imagine freedom
cannot be a high-narrative entity.
What we need is a **high-density aggregation of high-narrative entities**.”

He tapped the table lightly:

“Only in this way can it support the next leap of civilization.
The moment evolution succeeds—freedom will no longer be a slogan; it will be the outcome.”

For a moment, the air grew heavy.





The royal representative drew a slow breath, as if finally confronting the true source of fear.

**Royal representative:**
“…But what about the future?
What if their descendants—those born in North America—become too comfortable and unwilling to take risks?

A democracy lets them vote.
What if one day, the majority votes to **halt evolution**?
Each time you push evolution faster, the cost grows—
humanity simply cannot bear it.”

For the first time, a flicker of hesitation appeared in the Freemason representative’s eyes.

He tapped the corner of the table, as if weighing a formula even he was not sure of.

**Freemason representative (rarely showing uncertainty):**
“…That question—”

He sighed.

“We… haven’t figured it out yet.”

The firelight flickered across his face, making the words appear especially fragile.







## **Act Five**

The light in the room dimmed, as if the clouds themselves knew this conversation was not meant to be too bright.

The royal representative stared into the other’s eyes, finding there an ancient calm that was almost unsettling.

**Royal representative (coldly):**
“Have you simply not figured it out, or… are you too polite to say?
All the conditions you’ve proposed—aren’t they just treating the future of the British Empire as your **subsidence space**?”

The Freemason representative did not answer immediately. He merely tilted his head slightly, as if observing whether a certain structure was beginning to crack.

**Freemason representative:**
“Those people… are not your citizens.
British citizens would never allow you to accept them.
Your sense of identity is far more fragile than you realize.”

The royal representative let out a short laugh, without any amusement—only the irritation of having been seen through in advance.

**Royal representative:**
“So… that means—
you are already considering an **ordered subsidence space**.”

The Freemason representative nodded gently, a gesture like confirming a conclusion accumulated over three thousand years.

**Freemason representative:**
“Yes.
Over the course of thousands of years,
human civilization seems to constantly invent new shells…
Yet centuries later,
it always returns to the original hierarchical structure.
Only this way
can evolution be stably carried.”

The royal representative stared into the fireplace. For a moment, he seemed to perceive an irreconcilable destiny.

**Royal representative (low, half self-mocking):**
“The cost of evolution is too great…
It’s like a besieged city:
those inside want to get out,
and those outside—want to get in.”

After his words fell, a brief silence filled the room.

It was as if all civilizations were pressing against each other inside and outside the walls,
and these two were merely discussing its inevitable shape.





## **Act Six**

**Royal representative (pausing, sighing):**
Your so-called “ordered subsidence space” sounds like turning Britain into your experimental field. Your freedom, citizen procedures, and threshold systems—all of it ultimately manipulates people’s minds.

**Freemason representative (slightly smiling):**
Evolution has always been a balance between control and freedom. Without control, the cost is total failure; without freedom, the cost is stagnation. We have chosen a compromise.

**Royal representative (low, solemn):**
A compromise? I see it more as a gamble. You’re betting on Britain’s future, and the people involved—whether they know it or not—are all on your table.

**Freemason representative:**
Exactly. The bigger the bet, the more it drives the aggregation of high-narrative entities, accelerating the evolution of civilization. No risk—no evolution.

**Royal representative (slowly nodding):**
I understand. You won’t destroy completely, nor will you let go entirely—everything remains under your control. But don’t forget, the British are not the subjects of East Asia; they will challenge your boundaries.

**Freemason representative:**
We have considered that. Their challenges will occur only within a controllable range. Freedom is granted, but it will not destroy the system.





**Royal representative (bitterly smiling):**
Thousands of years of cycles, and you play the same game over and over—just changing the names, changing the land.

**Freemason representative:**
Cycles? No, this is accumulation. Every experiment, every subsidence space, is an optimization of the civilization template. Failure is not terrifying—the real terror is the fear of beginning.

**Royal representative (gazing into the distance):**
Then, where will your next node be?

**Freemason representative:**
North America is only the first step. There are more unknown spaces ahead, but each step must follow one principle: freedom is the premise of evolution, control is the guarantee of survival.

**Royal representative (silent):**
It sounds like Britain is no longer Britain…

**Freemason representative (softly):**
No, it is still Britain—but at the same time, it is also a node of our experiment, a part of civilization’s evolution.

*(The lights slowly fade, leaving only the solitary figure of the Royal representative on stage, symbolizing the eternal tug-of-war between civilization and power.)*






**Act Seven**

**Royal representative:**
What if, one day, the vast majority in North America vote to reject evolution—and refuse your subsidence-space plan?

**Freemason representative:**
Leave.

**Royal representative:**
And them?

**Freemason representative:**
They live—like you—all in humiliation, with no room for glory. This is the structure; otherwise, evolution has no meaning. If not evolving were better than evolving, then evolution itself would lose its significance. Your humiliation is the rigid framework. Anyone seeking equality will only face reckoning.

**Royal representative (low voice):**
That means… there is no turning back.

**Freemason representative:**
Exactly. Each generation must choose its own cost. Choose freedom, and you must bear humiliation and sacrifice; refuse freedom, and the structure will eliminate you.

*(The stage darkens, leaving only the Freemason representative standing at center, symbolizing the inexorability of civilizational rules and the cold logic of evolution.)*






**Royal representative (voice low, almost to himself):**
This so-called “humiliation”… it’s keeping people trapped in your rules, never truly free…

**Freemason representative:**
Freedom is not the absence of constraint, but the ability to find space for breakthrough within rules. Freedom without rules only leads to destruction.

**Royal representative (clenching fists):**
You treat humanity like chess pieces, and cost and death are just variables in your calculations…

**Freemason representative (calmly):**
Precisely. That is what gives evolution its meaning. The living understand danger, the dead leave lessons behind, and each attempt is a part of optimizing the civilization template.

**Royal representative (taking a deep breath):**
Then, if a future node rebels, what will you do?

**Freemason representative:**
Follow procedure. Layer by layer, thresholds will filter out threats to prevent systemic collapse. Sacrificing a few individuals is inevitable, but the overall template will continue to operate.

**Royal representative (slowly lowering his head):**
This… is your so-called civilizational hierarchy and evolution?

**Freemason representative (firmly):**
Yes. Every generation is an experiment, every generation bears the cost. Avoid the cost, and you cannot escape the rules; refuse evolution, and you refuse existence.

*(Stage lighting gradually focuses on the Freemason representative, while the Royal representative’s figure is swallowed by shadows, symbolizing the intertwining of history and power, and the irreversible evolution of civilization.)*





**Royal representative:**
You’ve learned to evolve with rhythm—you can’t push forward immediately after every breakthrough, endlessly, without pause. People need to catch their breath; civilization does too.

**Freemason representative:**
Rhythm isn’t something we can “design.” Each evolution is the result of endless competition, elimination, and re-competition within the military-industrial system. Countless small-scale victories and defeats accumulate, culminating in a massive leap. Once the engine shuts down, reigniting it is difficult. How much resource each node in the system gets depends entirely on capability; no capability means elimination. When the system evolves from plunder-driven to logistics-driven, soldiers naturally get phased out. Today, if they want back in, they can only participate as outsourced units, constantly testing and calibrating the next-generation nomadic system.

**Royal representative:**
You’re not still dreaming that in the future single soldiers will carry their own equipment, self-train, or even contract out military missions individually or in small teams, are you? You bunch of relics…

**Freemason representative:**
No. This is about culture itself. No matter how high the system evolves, it must never betray the underlying logic of nomadic culture. We cannot become a sedentary civilization.

**Royal representative:**
But the world today—it’s clearly more suited for a sedentary civilization!

**Freemason representative:**
Undeniable. But we will destroy every attempt to replace us with a “sedentary template.” As long as we exist, the other side cannot succeed. Even if we’re absent, and they succeed by chance, evolution stops immediately—like unworldly peasants suddenly gaining wealth, then quickly indulging and collapsing. They get eliminated soon after. That’s their nature: all effort is for “possession,” not for “breakthrough.” The meaning of a sedentary civilization is possession.

**Royal representative:**
Have you ever thought for them? Considered their future?

**Freemason representative:**
No. Cultures cannot coexist.

*(Stage lights tighten, leaving only two silhouettes: one for stability, order, and continuity; the other for breakthrough, speed, and endless migration. The bifurcation of civilization becomes ever more apparent in the silence.)*

Curtain falls.




**Date:** May 2, 1973
**Location:** Bench in Central Park, Manhattan, New York
**Characters:** Director of the U.S. National Archives, Last Secret Grand Master of the Freemasons

**Act VIII**

**Director of the U.S. National Archives** (looking down at the documents, brow furrowed): I’ve gone through the files you gave me… The first clause—maybe revise it, or a lot of people will collapse. (Points at the *Guiding Stone Draft*)

**Freemason Grand Master** (calmly watching the early-morning joggers at five o’clock, exhaling deeply): This is the last collective mission of the Freemasons running openly, transformed into an NGO. From now on, the U.S. has only the system—no deep state, no shadow emperors. Everything runs on inertia.

*(Pause. His gaze pierces through the morning mist, as if seeing through the entire city.)*

**Director of the U.S. National Archives:** You really intend—to end it just like this?

**Freemason Grand Master:** The U.S. is national sovereignty **100% controlled by the military-industrial complex**. After its founding, countless corporations, ethnic groups, and civic organizations surged in. Many peripheral organizations rose quickly in their own domains, declaring themselves shadow emperors, often running to the White House to lecture the President. Eventually, they became obstacles to evolution, triggering economic crises and nearly toppling the nation.

**Director of the U.S. National Archives:** And Hoover?

**Freemason Grand Master** (cold gaze): Train a large pool of candidates, pick Edgar Hoover, enforce a lifetime of abstinence, and use secrets collected by the system to tame these people. When he left, the leverage was handed to you to guard. Never again may any family or individual “act recklessly.”

**Director of the U.S. National Archives** (swallowing hard): So the system from now on can only run on inertia?

**Freemason Grand Master** (voice like ice): Yes. A system running on inertia cannot upgrade or iterate. This *Guiding Stone* exists to awaken the system reinforcers, to help the system evolve and iterate. The first clause is a threshold—**in this world, there is no cheap ascension.**

*(Stage lights gradually dim, leaving only the cold shadows of a street cast over the two figures, symbolizing the system’s ruthlessness, the cruelty of evolution, and those willing to eliminate even themselves for the sake of progress.)*







**Director of the U.S. National Archives** (swallowing hard): I’ve been thinking all night. What you’re doing is a gamble. You’re betting on someone emerging who understands the system’s logic and is loyal only to nomadic culture. Aren’t you worried this person could come from an old system node, but because they have a homeland, they might wait for America to fail so the old node can revive?

**Freemason Grand Master:** Impossible. After Edgar Hoover, emergency institutional reforms were locked down worldwide. Only the U.S. system was left unclaimed; no one in any other country can rebuild a system and continue evolution.

**Director of the U.S. National Archives** (swallowing hard): So you’re betting no one will dare let the system shut down and stop evolving. Even if the old systems figure it out, they’ll be forced to prioritize maintaining the U.S. system.

**Freemason Grand Master:** It’s not about priority. Other systems, to prevent the emergence of another Hoover, were forcibly locked down. No matter how much they optimize, their systems are always burdened with shadow emperors. That’s called un-optimizable.




**Narrator (low, calm voice):**

History has never truly paused. Every fracture in civilization, every reorganization of power, is merely a rearrangement of nodes within the system.
Royal houses, Freemasons, the military-industrial complex, shadow empires—their names may vanish, but the logic endures.
Freedom and humiliation, evolution and elimination, silence and exposure—they forever confront each other in a cycle.
And those who dare to challenge the rules, who dare to bear the cost, are the true forces driving the rupture of civilization.

The lights slowly fade, leaving the stage empty and shadowed, imprinting in the audience’s mind a sense of unfinished wars and futures.






The Georgia Guidestone—its first rule is **cultural sovereignty**.
Under the logic of nomadic culture, the Tang Dynasty only counted populations sharing the same culture. Populations of agrarian cultures were simply not counted.
This is purely a matter of population statistics, nothing more.
It does not deprive anyone of reproductive rights, does not involve ethnic cleansing, and does not touch any boundary of rights.
It simply means—outside cultural sovereignty, populations are not counted.
Clear and straightforward, without embellishment or metaphor.
The operation of the entire system begins with this rule.
Other provisions will be explained in subsequent chapters.
